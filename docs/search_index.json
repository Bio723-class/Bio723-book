Magwene 2018-03-21 Chapter 1 Introduction Bio 723 (formerly Bio 313) is a course I offer at Duke University. The focus of this course is statistical computing for the biological sciences with an emphasis on common multivariate statistical methods and techniques for exploratory data analysis. A major goal of the course is to help graduate students in the biological sciences develop practical insights into methods that they are likely to encounter in their own research, and the potential advantages and pitfalls that come with their use. In terms of mathematical perspectives, the course emphasize a geometric approach to understanding multivariate statistics. I try to help students develop an intuition for the geometry of vector spaces and discuss topics like correlation, regression, and principal components analysis in terms of angles between vectors, dot products, and projection. 1.1 How to use these lecture notes In this and future materials to be posted on the course website you’ll encounter blocks of R code. Your natural intuition will be to cut and paste commands or code blocks into the R interpretter to save yourself the typing. DO NOT DO THIS!! In each of the examples below, I provide example input, but I don’t show you the output. It’s your job to type in these examples at the R console, evaluate what you typed, and to look at and think critically about the output. You will make mistakes and generate errors! Part of learning any new skill is making mistakes, figuring out where you went wrong, and correcting those mistakes. In the process of fixing those errors, you’ll learn more about how R works, and how to avoid such errors, or correct bugs in your own code in the future. If you cut and paste the examples into the R interpretter the code will run, but you will learn less than if you input the code yourself and you’ll be less capable of apply the concepts in new situations. The R interpretter, like all programming languages, is very exacting. A mispelled variable or function name, a stray period, or an unbalanced parenthesis will raise an error and finding the sources of such errors can sometimes be tedious and frustrating. Persist! If you read your code critically, think about what your doing, and seek help when needed (teaching team, R help, Google, etc) you’ll eventually get better at debugging your code. But keep in mind that like most new skills, learning to write and debug your code efficiently takes time and experience. "],

R is a statistical computing environment and programming language. It is free, open source, and has a large and active community of developers and users. There are many different R packages (libraries) available for conducting out a wide variety of different analyses, for everything from genome sequence data to geospatial information. 2.2 What is RStudio? RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/) is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a nicer graphical interface to R than does the default R GUI. The figure below illustrates the RStudio interface, in it’s default configuration. For the exercises below you’ll be primarily entering commands in the “console” window. We’ll review key parts of the RStudio interface in greater detail in class. Figure 2.1: RStudio window with the panes labeled 2.3 Entering commands in the console You can type commands directly in the console. When you hit Return (Enter) on your keyboard the text you typed is evaluated by the R interpreter. This means that the R program reads your commands, makes sure there are no syntax errors, and then carries out any commands that were specified. Try evaluating the following arithmetic commands in the console: 10 + 5 [1] 15 10 - 5 [1] 5 10 / 5 [1] 2 10 * 5 [1] 50 If you type an incomplete command and then hit Return on your keyboard, the console will show a continuation line marked by a + symbol. For example enter the incomplete statement (10 + 5 and then hit Enter. You should see something like this. &gt; (10 + 5 + The continuation line tells you that R is waiting for additional input before it evaluates what you typed. Either complete your command (e.g. type the closing parenthesis) and hit Return, or hit the “Esc” key to exit the continuation line without evaluating what you typed. 2.4 Comments When working in the R console, or writing R code, the pound symbol (#) indicates the start of a comment. Anything after the #, up to the end of the current line, is ignored by the R interpretter. # This line will be ignored 5 + 4 # the first part of this line, up to the #, will be evaluated [1] 9 Throughout this course I will often include short explanatory comments in my code examples. 2.5 Using R as a Calculator The simplest way to use R is as a fancy calculator. 10 + 2 # addition 10 - 2 # subtraction 10 * 2 # multiplication 10 / 2 # division 10 ^ 2 # exponentiation 10 ** 2 # alternate exponentiation pi * 2.5^2 # R knows about some constants such as Pi 10 %% 3 # modulus operator -- gives remainder after division 10 %/% 3 # integer division Be aware that certain operators have precedence over others. For example multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Use parentheses to disambiguate potentially confusing statements. (10 + 2)/4-5 # was the output what you expected? [1] -2 (10 + 2)/(4-5) # compare the answer to the above [1] -12 Division by zero produces an object that represents infinite numbers. Infinite values can be either positive or negative 1/0 # Inf [1] Inf -1/0 # -Inf [1] -Inf Invalid calculations produce a objected called NaN which is short for “Not a Number”: 0/0 # invalid calculation [1] NaN 2.5.1 Common mathematical functions Many commonly used mathematical functions are built into R. Here are some examples: abs(-3) # absolute value [1] 3 abs(3) [1] 3 cos(pi/3) # cosine [1] 0.5 sin(pi/3) # sine [1] 0.8660254 log(10) # natural logarithm [1] 2.302585 log10(10) # log base 10 [1] 1 log2(10) # log base 2 [1] 3.321928 exp(1) # exponential function [1] 2.718282 sqrt(10) # square root [1] 3.162278 10 ^ 0.5 # same as square root [1] 3.162278 2.6 Numeric data types in R There are three standard types of numbers in R. You can use the function typeof() to get information about an objects type in R. “double” – this is the default numeric data type, and is used to represent both real numbers and whole numbers (unless you explicitly ask for integers, see below). “double” is short for “double precision floating point value”. All of the previous computations you’ve seen up until this point used data of type double. typeof(10.0) # real number [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(10) # whole numbers default to doubles [1] &quot;double&quot; “integer” – when your numeric data involves only whole numbers, you can get slighly better performance using the integer data type. You must explicitly ask for numbers to be treated as integers. typeof(as.integer(10)) # now treated as an integer [1] &quot;integer&quot; “complex” – R has a built-in data type to represent complex numbers – numbers with a “real” and “imaginary” component. We won’t encounter the use of complex numbers in this course, but they do have many important uses in mathematics and engineering and also have some interesting applications in biology. typeof(1 + 0i) [1] &quot;complex&quot; sqrt(-1) # sqrt of -1, using doubles [1] NaN sqrt(-1 + 0i) # sqrt of -1, using complex numbers [1] 0+1i 2.7 Variable assignment in R An important programming concept in all programming languages is that of “variable assignment”. Variable assignment is the act of creating labels that point to particular data values in a computers memory, which allows us to apply operations to the labels rather than directly to specific. Variable assignment is an important mechanism of abstracting and generalizing computational operations. Variable assignment in R is accomplished with the assignment operator, which is designated as &lt;- (left arrow, constructed from a left angular brack and the minus sign). This is illustrated below: x &lt;- 10 # assign the variable name &#39;x&#39; the value 10 sin(x) # apply the sin function to the value x points to [1] -0.5440211 x &lt;- pi # x now points to a different value sin(x) # the same function call now produces a different result [1] 1.224647e-16 2.7.1 Valid variable names As described in the R documentation, “A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as ‘.2way’ are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.” Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names. Mentally evaluate these based on the definition above, and then evaluate these in the R interpetter to confirm your understanding : x &lt;- 10 x.prime &lt;- 10 x_prime &lt;- 10 my.long.variable.name &lt;- 10 another_long_variable_name &lt;- 10 _x &lt;- 10 .x &lt;- 10 2.x &lt;- 2 * x 2.8 Working with Vectors in R Vectors are the core data structure in R. Vectors store an ordered lists of items, all of the same type. Learning to compute effectively with vectors and one of the keys to efficient R programming. Vectors in R always have a type (accessed with the typeof() function) and a length (accessed with the length() function). The simplest way to create a vector at the interactive prompt is to use the c() function, which is short hand for combine' orconcatenate’. x &lt;- c(2,4,6,8) # create a vector, assignn it the variable name `x` length(x) [1] 4 typeof(x) [1] &quot;double&quot; You can also use c() to concatenate two or more vectors together. y &lt;- c(1,3,5,7,9) # create another vector, labeled y xy &lt;- c(x,y) # combine two vectors z &lt;- c(pi/4, pi/2, pi, 2*pi) xyz &lt;- c(x, y, z) # combine three vectors 2.8.1 Vector Arithmetic The basic R arithmetic operations work on vectors as well as on single numbers (in fact single numbers are vectors). x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x * 2 # multiply each element of x by 2 [1] 4 8 12 16 20 x - pi # subtract pi from each element of x [1] -1.1415927 0.8584073 2.8584073 4.8584073 6.8584073 y &lt;- c(0, 1, 3, 5, 9) x + y # add together each matching element of x and y [1] 2 5 9 13 19 x * y # multiply each matching element of x and y [1] 0 4 18 40 90 x/y # divide each matching element of x and y [1] Inf 4.000000 2.000000 1.600000 1.111111 Basic numerical functions operate element-wise on numerical vectors: sin(x) [1] 0.9092974 -0.7568025 -0.2794155 0.9893582 -0.5440211 cos(x * pi) [1] 1 1 1 1 1 log(x) [1] 0.6931472 1.3862944 1.7917595 2.0794415 2.3025851 2.8.2 Vector recycling When vectors are not of the same length R `recycles’ the elements of the shorter vector to make the lengths conform. x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) length(x) [1] 5 z &lt;- c(1, 4, 7, 11) length(z) [1] 4 x + z [1] 3 8 13 19 11 In the example above z was treated as if it was the vector (1, 4, 7, 11, 1). 2.8.3 Simple statistical functions for numeric vectors Now that we’ve introduced vectors as the simplest data structure for holding collections of numerical values, we can introduce a few of the most common statistical functions that operate on such vectors. First let’s create a vector to hold our sample data of interest. Here I’ve taken a random sample of the lengths of the last names of students enrolled in Bio 723 during Spring 2018. len.name &lt;- c(7, 7, 6, 2, 9, 9, 7, 4, 10, 5) Some common statistics of interest include minimum, maximum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation: min(len.name) [1] 2 max(len.name) [1] 10 mean(len.name) [1] 6.6 median(len.name) [1] 7 var(len.name) # variance [1] 6.044444 sd(len.name) # standard deviation [1] 2.458545 The summary() function applied to a vector of doubles produce a useful table of some of these key statistics: summary(len.name) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 2.00 5.25 7.00 6.60 8.50 10.00 2.9 The R Help System R comes with fairly extensive documentation and a simple help system. You can access HTML versions of the R documentation under the Help tab in Rstudio. The HTML documentation also includes information on any packages you’ve installed. Take a few minutes to browse through the R HTML documentation. In addition to the HTML documentation there is also a search box where you can enter a term to search on (see red arrow in figure below). Figure 2.2: The RStudio Help tab 2.9.1 Getting help from the console In addition to getting help from the RStudio help tab, you can directly search for help from the console. The help system can be invoked using the help function or the ? operator. help(&quot;log&quot;) ?log If you are using RStudio, the help results will appear in the “Help” tab of the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (lower right window by default). What if you don’t know the name of the function you want? You can use the help.search() function. help.search(&quot;log&quot;) In this case help.search(&quot;log&quot;) returns all the functions with the string log in them. For more on help.search type ?help.search. Other useful help related functions include apropos() and example(). apropos returns a list of all objects (including function names) in the current session that match the input string. apropos(&quot;log&quot;) [1] &quot;as.data.frame.logical&quot; &quot;as.logical&quot; [3] &quot;as.logical.factor&quot; &quot;dlogis&quot; [5] &quot;is.logical&quot; &quot;log&quot; [7] &quot;log10&quot; &quot;log1p&quot; [9] &quot;log2&quot; &quot;logb&quot; [11] &quot;Logic&quot; &quot;logical&quot; [13] &quot;logLik&quot; &quot;loglin&quot; [15] &quot;plogis&quot; &quot;qlogis&quot; [17] &quot;rlogis&quot; &quot;SSlogis&quot; example() provides examples of how a function is used. example(log) log&gt; log(exp(3)) [1] 3 log&gt; log10(1e7) # = 7 [1] 7 log&gt; x &lt;- 10^-(1+2*1:9) log&gt; cbind(x, log(1+x), log1p(x), exp(x)-1, expm1(x)) x [1,] 1e-03 9.995003e-04 9.995003e-04 1.000500e-03 1.000500e-03 [2,] 1e-05 9.999950e-06 9.999950e-06 1.000005e-05 1.000005e-05 [3,] 1e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 [4,] 1e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 [5,] 1e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 [6,] 1e-13 9.992007e-14 1.000000e-13 9.992007e-14 1.000000e-13 [7,] 1e-15 1.110223e-15 1.000000e-15 1.110223e-15 1.000000e-15 [8,] 1e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-17 [9,] 1e-19 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-19 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-19 2.10 Packages Packages are libraries of R functions and data that provide additional capabilities and tools beyond the standard library of functions included with R. Hundreds of people around the world have developed packages for R that provide functions and related data structures for conducting many different types of analyses. Throughout this course you’ll need to install a variety of packages. Here I show the basic procedure for installing new packages from the console as well as from the R Studio interface. 2.10.1 Installing packages from the console The built-in function install.packages provides a quick and conveniet way to install packages from the R console. 2.10.2 Install the tidyverse package To illustrate the use of install.package, we’ll install a collection of packages (a “meta-package”) called the tidyverse. Here’s how to install the tidyverse meta-package from the R console: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) The first argument to install.packages gives the names of the package we want to install. The second argument, dependencies = TRUE, tells R to install any additional packages that tidyverse depends on. 2.10.3 Installing packages from the RStudio dialog You can also install packages using a graphical dialog provided by RStudio. To do so pick the Packages tab in RStudio, and then click the Install button. Figure 2.3: The Packages tab in RStudio In the packages entry box you can type the name of the package you wish to install. 2.10.4 Install the stringr package Let’s install another useful package called “stringr”. Type the package name in the “Packages” field, make sure the “Install dependencies” check box is checked, and then press the “Install” button. Figure 2.4: Package Install Dialog 2.10.5 Loading packages with the library() function Once a package is installed on your computer, the package can be loaded into your R session using the library function. To insure our previous install commands worked correctly, let’s load the packages we just installed. library(stringr) library(tidyverse) Since the tidyverse pacakge is a “meta-package” it provides some additional info about the sub-packages that got loaded. When you load tidyverse, you will also see a message about “Conflicts” as several of the functions provided in the dplyr package (a sub-package in tidyverse) conflict with names of functions provided by the “stats” package which usually gets automically loaded when you start R. The conflicting funcdtions are filter and lag. The conflicting functions in the stats package are lag and filter which are used in time series analysis. The dplyr functions are more generally useful. Furthermore, if you need these masked functions you can still access them by prefacing the function name with the name of the package (e.g. stats::filter). "],
["r-basics-data-types-and-data-structures.html", "Chapter 3 R Basics: Data types and data structures 3.1 Logical (Boolean) values 3.2 Character strings 3.3 Vectors 3.4 Lists 3.5 Data frames", " Chapter 3 R Basics: Data types and data structures In the previous chapter we began our exploration of R with some simple numerical examples. We discussed the three basic numeric data types in R (doubles, integers, complex numbers), illustrated simple mathematical functions (abs, log, cos, etc), introduced the concept of variable assignment, and made use of a simple data structure called a vector. In this chapter we’re going to: 1) introduced two additional data types (logical and character types); 2) expand our knowledge of R vectors; and 3) introduce two new data structures (lists and data frames). 3.1 Logical (Boolean) values The “logical” data type (know as “Booleans” in many other languages, after the mathematician George Bools) represent true or false values. These are written TRUE and FALSE in R. typeof(TRUE) [1] &quot;logical&quot; typeof(FALSE) [1] &quot;logical&quot; Logical values or returned by numeric comparison operations such as testing equality, less than, greater than, etc. This is illustrated below 10 &lt; 9 # less than [1] FALSE 10 &gt; 9 # greater than [1] TRUE 10 &lt;= (5 * 2) # less than or equal to [1] TRUE 10 &gt;= pi # greater than or equal to [1] TRUE 10 == 10 # equals [1] TRUE 10 != 10 # does not equal [1] FALSE 10 == (sqrt(10)^2) # Surprised by the result? See below. [1] FALSE 4 == (sqrt(4)^2) # Even more confused? [1] TRUE Be careful to distinguish between == (tests equality) and = (the alternative assignment operator equivalent to &lt;-). I encourage you to only use the = assignment operator in function calls, so as to help avoid confusion between testing for equality and assignment. How about the last two statement comparing two values to the square of their square roots? Mathematically we know that both \\((\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10\\) and \\((\\sqrt{4})^2 = 4\\) are true statements. Why does R tell us the first statement is false? What we’re running into here are the limits of computer precision. A computer can’t represent \\(\\sqrt 10\\) exactly, whereas \\(\\sqrt 4\\) can be exactly represented. Precision in numerical computing is a complex subject and a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this course. Later in the course we’ll discuss some ways of implementing sanity checks to avoid situations like that illustrated above. 3.1.1 Comparison operators applied to numeric vectors Comparison operators can be applied to numeric vectors. As with other vector operations, the comparison operators are applied element by element, and the value returned is a vector of logical values. x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) y &lt;- c(3, 2, 1) x &gt; y # compare each matching element [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE 3.1.2 Logical vectors As illustrated above, comparison operations applied to numeric vectors return logical vectors. You can create your own logical vectors with the c() function in the same way as we create numeric vectors: ww &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) zz &lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE) 3.1.3 Logical operators Logical values support Boolean operations, like logical negation (“not”), “and”, “or”, “xor”, etc. This is illustrated below: x &lt;- TRUE y &lt;- FALSE !x # logical negation [1] FALSE x &amp; y # AND: are x and y both TRUE? [1] FALSE x | y # OR: are either x or y TRUE? [1] TRUE xor(x,y) # XOR: is either x or y TRUE, but not both? [1] TRUE The logical operators above work element-wise on logical vectors: xx &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) yy &lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE) !xx # logical negation, element-wise [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE xx &amp; yy # element-wise AND, note recycling of shorter vector [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE The function isTRUE is sometimes useful, especially when writing functions. isTRUE applies to length-one logical vectors. x &lt;- 5 y &lt;- 10 z &lt;- x &gt; y isTRUE(z) [1] FALSE 3.2 Character strings Character strings (“character”) represent single textual characters or longer string. They are created by wrapping text either single our double quotes. typeof(&quot;a&quot;) [1] &quot;character&quot; typeof(&quot;abc&quot;) [1] &quot;character&quot; Character strings have a length, which can be found using the nchar function: first.name &lt;- &quot;jasmine&quot; nchar(first.name) [1] 7 There are a number of built-in functions for manipulating character strings. Here are some of the most common ones: last.name &lt;- &#39;smith&#39; paste(first.name, last.name) # join strings [1] &quot;jasmine smith&quot; substr(first.name, 1, 3) # get substrings [1] &quot;jas&quot; 3.2.1 The stringr package The stringr package provides a variety of useful functions for working with character strings. You should have already installed the stringr package (see the Installing Packages handout), but do so now if you forgot. All of the functions in the stringr package are prefixed with str_. Here are some examples: # You don&#39;t need to reload packages if you already loaded # them in your R session. This is just for completeness. library(stringr) darwin.quote &lt;- &quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one...&quot; str_length(darwin.quote) # equivalent to nchar [1] 128 # how many times does the character &quot;s&quot; appear in the string? str_count(darwin.quote, &quot;s&quot;) [1] 6 # duplicate a string str_dup(&quot;hello&quot;, 3) [1] &quot;hellohellohello&quot; # other interesting functions str_to_title(&quot;on the origin of species&quot;) [1] &quot;On The Origin Of Species&quot; str_to_upper(&quot;loud and bombastic&quot;) [1] &quot;LOUD AND BOMBASTIC&quot; 3.3 Vectors We previously introduced the vector data structure in a previous hands-on document (see “Getting Started with R”). Here we’ll explore some additional operations on vectors. Just as a reminder, vectors store an ordered list of items all of the same type (e.g. numeric, logical, character). Vectors in R always have a length (accessed with the length() function) and a type (accessed with the typeof() function). 3.3.1 Indexing Vectors For a vector of length \\(n\\), we can access the elements by the indices \\(1 \\ldots n\\). We say that R vectors (and other data structures like lists) are `one-indexed’. Many other programming languages, such as Python, C, and Java, use zero-indexing where the elements of a data structure are accessed by the indices \\(0 \\ldots n-1\\). Indexing errors are a common source of bugs. Indexing a vector is done by specifying the index in square brackets as shown below: x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) length(x) [1] 5 x[1] [1] 2 x[4] [1] 8 Negative indices are used to exclude particular elements. x[-1] returns all elements of x except the first. x[-1] [1] 4 6 8 10 You can get multiple elements of a vector by indexing by another vector. In the example below, x[c(3,5)] returns the third and fifth element of x`. x[c(3,5)] [1] 6 10 3.3.2 Combining Indexing and Comparison of Vectors A very powerful feature of R is the ability to combine the comparison operators with indexing. This facilitates data filtering and subsetting. Some examples: x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x[x &gt; 5] [1] 6 8 10 x[x &lt; 4 | x &gt; 6] [1] 2 8 10 In the first example we retrieved all the elements of x that are larger than 5 (read as “x where x is greater than 5”). In the second example we retrieved those elements of x that were smaller than four or greater than six. Combining indexing and comparison is a powerful concept which we’ll use repeatedly in this course. 3.3.3 Vector manipulation You can combine indexing with assignment to change the elements of a vectors: x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x[2] &lt;- -4 x [1] 2 -4 6 8 10 You can also use indexing vectors to change multiple values at once: x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x[c(1, 3, 5)] &lt;- 6 x [1] 6 4 6 8 6 Using logical vectors to manipulate the elements of a vector also works: x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x[x &gt; 5] = 5 # truncate all values to have max value 5 x [1] 2 4 5 5 5 3.3.4 Vectors from regular sequences There are a variety of functions for creating regular sequences in the form of vectors. 1:10 # create a vector with the integer values from 1 to 10 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20:11 # a vector with the integer values from 20 to 11 [1] 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 seq(1, 10) # like 1:10 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq(1, 10, by = 2) # 1:10, in steps of 2 [1] 1 3 5 7 9 seq(2, 4, by = 0.25) # 2 to 4, in steps of 0.25 [1] 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 3.3.5 Additional functions for working with vectors The function unique() returns the unique items in a vector: x &lt;- c(5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5, 7, 9) unique(x) [1] 5 2 1 4 6 9 8 7 rev() returns the items in reverse order (without changing the input vector): y &lt;- rev(x) y [1] 9 7 5 8 9 6 4 1 2 5 x # x is still in original order [1] 5 2 1 4 6 9 8 5 7 9 There are a number of useful functions related to sorting. Plain sort() returns a new vector with the items in sorted order: sort(x) # returns items of x sorted [1] 1 2 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 9 x # but x remains in its unsorted state [1] 5 2 1 4 6 9 8 5 7 9 The related function order() gives the indices which would rearrange the items into sorted order: order(x) [1] 3 2 4 1 8 5 9 7 6 10 order() can be useful when you want to sort one list by the values of another: students &lt;- c(&quot;fred&quot;, &quot;tabitha&quot;, &quot;beatriz&quot;, &quot;jose&quot;) class.ranking &lt;- c(4, 2, 1, 3) students[order(class.ranking)] # get the students sorted by their class.ranking [1] &quot;beatriz&quot; &quot;tabitha&quot; &quot;jose&quot; &quot;fred&quot; any() and all(), return single boolean values based on a specified comparison provided as an argument: y &lt;- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 8) any(y &gt; 5) # returns TRUE if any of the elements are TRUE [1] TRUE all(y &gt; 5) # returns TRUE if all of the elements are TRUE [1] FALSE which() returns the indices of the vector for which the input is true: which(y &gt; 5) [1] 4 5 3.4 Lists R lists are like vectors, but unlike a vector where all the elements are of the same type, the elements of a list can have arbitrary types (even other lists). Lists are a powerful data structure for organizing information, because there are few constraints on the shape or types of the data included in a list. Lists are easy to create: l &lt;- list(&#39;Bob&#39;, pi, 10) Note that lists can contain arbitrary data. Lists can even contain other lists: l &lt;- list(&#39;Bob&#39;, pi, 10, list(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;qux&quot;)) Lists are displayed with a particular format, distinct from vectors: l [[1]] [1] &quot;Bob&quot; [[2]] [1] 3.141593 [[3]] [1] 10 [[4]] [[4]][[1]] [1] &quot;foo&quot; [[4]][[2]] [1] &quot;bar&quot; [[4]][[3]] [1] &quot;baz&quot; [[4]][[4]] [1] &quot;qux&quot; In the example above, the correspondence between the list and its display is obvious for the first three items. The fourth element may be a little confusing at first. Remember that the fourth item of l was another list. So what’s being shown in the output for the fourth item is the nested list. An alternative way to display a list is using the str() function (short for “structure”). str() provides a more compact representation that also tells us what type of data each element is: str(l) List of 4 $ : chr &quot;Bob&quot; $ : num 3.14 $ : num 10 $ :List of 4 ..$ : chr &quot;foo&quot; ..$ : chr &quot;bar&quot; ..$ : chr &quot;baz&quot; ..$ : chr &quot;qux&quot; 3.4.1 Length and type of lists Like vectors, lists have length: length(l) [1] 4 But the type of a list is simply “list”, not the type of the items within the list. This makes sense because lists are allowed to be heterogeneous (i.e. hold data of different types). typeof(l) [1] &quot;list&quot; 3.4.2 Indexing lists Lists have two indexing operators. Indexing a list with single brackets, like we did with vectors, returns a new list containing the element at index \\(i\\). Lists also support double bracket indexing (x[[i]]) which returns the bare element at index \\(i\\) (i.e. the element without the enclosing list). This is a subtle but important point so make sure you understand the difference between these two forms of indexing. 3.4.2.1 Single bracket list indexing First, let’s demonstrate single bracket indexing of the lists l we created above. l[1] # single brackets, returns list(&#39;Bob&#39;) [[1]] [1] &quot;Bob&quot; typeof(l[1]) # notice the list type [1] &quot;list&quot; When using single brackets, lists support indexing with ranges and numeric vectors: l[3:4] [[1]] [1] 10 [[2]] [[2]][[1]] [1] &quot;foo&quot; [[2]][[2]] [1] &quot;bar&quot; [[2]][[3]] [1] &quot;baz&quot; [[2]][[4]] [1] &quot;qux&quot; l[c(1, 3, 5)] [[1]] [1] &quot;Bob&quot; [[2]] [1] 10 [[3]] NULL 3.4.2.2 Double bracket list indexing If double bracket indexing is used, the object at the given index in a list is returned: l[[1]] # double brackets, return plain &#39;Bob&#39; [1] &quot;Bob&quot; typeof(l[[1]]) # notice the &#39;character&#39; type [1] &quot;character&quot; Double bracket indexing does not support multiple indices, but you can chain together double bracket operators to pull out the items of sublists. For example: # second item of the fourth item of the list l[[4]][[2]] [1] &quot;bar&quot; 3.4.3 Naming list elements The elements of a list can be given names when the list is created: p &lt;- list(first.name=&#39;Alice&#39;, last.name=&quot;Qux&quot;, age=27, years.in.school=10) You can retrieve the names associated with a list using the names function: names(p) [1] &quot;first.name&quot; &quot;last.name&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;years.in.school&quot; If a list has named elements, you can retrieve the corresponding elements by indexing with the quoted name in either single or double brackets. Consistent with previous usage, single brackets return a list with the corresponding named element, whereas double brackets return the bare element. For example, make sure you understand the difference in the output generated by these two indexing calls: p[&quot;first.name&quot;] $first.name [1] &quot;Alice&quot; p[[&quot;first.name&quot;]] [1] &quot;Alice&quot; 3.4.4 The $ operator Retrieving named elements of lists (and data frames as we’ll see), turns out to be a pretty common task (especially when doing interactive data analysis) so R has a special operator to make this more convenient. This is the $ operator, which is used as illustrated below: p$first.name # equivalent to p[[&quot;first.name&quot;]] [1] &quot;Alice&quot; p$age # equivalent to p[[&quot;age&quot;]] [1] 27 3.4.5 Changing and adding lists items Combining indexing and assignment allows you to change items in a list: suspect &lt;- list(first.name = &quot;unknown&quot;, last.name = &quot;unknown&quot;, aka = &quot;little&quot;) suspect$first.name &lt;- &quot;Bo&quot; suspect$last.name &lt;- &quot;Peep&quot; suspect[[3]] &lt;- &quot;LITTLE&quot; str(suspect) List of 3 $ first.name: chr &quot;Bo&quot; $ last.name : chr &quot;Peep&quot; $ aka : chr &quot;LITTLE&quot; By combining assignment with a new name or an index past the end of the list you can add items to a list: suspect$age &lt;- 17 # add a new item named age suspect[[5]] &lt;- &quot;shepardess&quot; # create an unnamed item at position 5 Be careful when adding an item using indexing, because if you skip an index an intervening NULL value is created: # there are only five items in the list, what happens if we # add a new item at position seven? suspect[[7]] &lt;- &quot;wanted for sheep stealing&quot; str(suspect) List of 7 $ first.name: chr &quot;Bo&quot; $ last.name : chr &quot;Peep&quot; $ aka : chr &quot;LITTLE&quot; $ age : num 17 $ : chr &quot;shepardess&quot; $ : NULL $ : chr &quot;wanted for sheep stealing&quot; 3.4.6 Combining lists The c (combine) function we introduced to create vectors can also be used to combine lists: list.a &lt;- list(&quot;little&quot;, &quot;bo&quot;, &quot;peep&quot;) list.b &lt;- list(&quot;has lost&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;) list.c &lt;- c(list.a, list.b) list.c [[1]] [1] &quot;little&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;bo&quot; [[3]] [1] &quot;peep&quot; [[4]] [1] &quot;has lost&quot; [[5]] [1] &quot;her&quot; [[6]] [1] &quot;sheep&quot; 3.4.7 Converting lists to vectors Sometimes it’s useful to convert a list to a vector. The unlist() function takes care of this for us. # a homogeneous list ex1 &lt;- list(2, 4, 6, 8) unlist(ex1) [1] 2 4 6 8 When you convert a list to a vector make sure you remember that vectors are homogeneous, so items within the new vector will be coerced to have the same type. # a heterogeneous list ex2 &lt;- list(2, 4, 6, c(&quot;bob&quot;, &quot;fred&quot;), list(1 + 0i, &#39;foo&#39;)) unlist(ex2) [1] &quot;2&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;bob&quot; &quot;fred&quot; &quot;1+0i&quot; &quot;foo&quot; Note that unlist() also unpacks nested vectors and lists as shown in the second example above. 3.5 Data frames Along with vectors and lists, data frames are one of the core data structures when working in R. A data frame is essentially a list which represents a data table, where each column in the table has the same number of rows and every item in the a column has to be of the same type. Unlike standard lists, the objects (columns) in a data frame must have names. We’ve seen data frames previously, for example when we loaded data sets using the read_csv function. 3.5.1 Creating a data frame While data frames will often be created by reading in a data set from a file, they can also be created directly in the console as illustrated below: age &lt;- c(30, 26, 21, 29, 25, 22, 28, 24, 23, 20) sex &lt;- rep(c(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;F&quot;), 5) wt.in.kg &lt;- c(88, 76, 67, 66, 56, 74, 71, 60, 52, 72) df &lt;- data.frame(age = age, sex = sex, wt = wt.in.kg) Here we created a data frame with three columns, each of length 10. 3.5.2 Type and class for data frames Data frames can be thought of as specialized lists, and in fact the type of a data frame is “list” as illustrated below: typeof(df) [1] &quot;list&quot; To distinguish a data frame from a generic list, we have to ask about it’s “class”. class(df) # the class of our data frame [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(l) # compare to the class of our generic list [1] &quot;list&quot; The term “class” comes from a style/approach to programming called “object oriented programming”. We won’t go into explicit detail about how object oriented programming works in this class, though we will exploit many of the features of objects that have a particular class. 3.5.3 Length and dimension for data frames Applying the length() function to a data frame returns the number of columns. This is consistent with the fact that data frames are specialized lists: length(df) [1] 3 To get the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of a data frame, we use the dim() function. dim() returns a vector, whose first value is the number of rows and whose second value is the number of columns: dim(df) [1] 10 3 We can get the number of rows and columns individually using the nrow() and ncol() functions: nrow(df) # number of rows [1] 10 ncol(df) # number of columsn [1] 3 3.5.4 Indexing and accessing data frames Data frames can be indexed by either column index, column name, row number, or a combination of row and column numbers. 3.5.4.1 Single bracket indexing of the columns of a data frame The single bracket operator with a single numeric index returns a data frame with the corresponding column. df[1] # get the first column (=age) of the data frame age 1 30 2 26 3 21 4 29 5 25 6 22 7 28 8 24 9 23 10 20 The single bracket operator with multiple numeric indices returns a data frame with the corresponding columns. df[1:2] # first two columns age sex 1 30 M 2 26 F 3 21 M 4 29 F 5 25 M 6 22 F 7 28 M 8 24 F 9 23 M 10 20 F df[c(1, 3)] # columns 1 (=age) and 3 (=wt) age wt 1 30 88 2 26 76 3 21 67 4 29 66 5 25 56 6 22 74 7 28 71 8 24 60 9 23 52 10 20 72 Column names can be substituted for indices when using the single bracket operator: df[&quot;age&quot;] age 1 30 2 26 3 21 4 29 5 25 6 22 7 28 8 24 9 23 10 20 df[c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)] age wt 1 30 88 2 26 76 3 21 67 4 29 66 5 25 56 6 22 74 7 28 71 8 24 60 9 23 52 10 20 72 3.5.4.2 Single bracket indexing of the rows of a data frame To get specific rows of a data frame, we use single bracket indexing with an additional comma following the index. For example to get the first row a data frame we would do: df[1,] # first row age sex wt 1 30 M 88 This syntax extends to multiple rows: df[1:2,] # first two rows age sex wt 1 30 M 88 2 26 F 76 df[c(1, 3, 5),] # rows 1, 3 and 5 age sex wt 1 30 M 88 3 21 M 67 5 25 M 56 3.5.4.3 Single bracket indexing of both the rows and columns of a data frame Single bracket indexing of data frames extends naturally to retrieve both rows and columns simultaneously: df[1, 2] # first row, second column [1] M Levels: F M df[1:3, 2:3] # first three rows, columns 2 and 3 sex wt 1 M 88 2 F 76 3 M 67 # you can even mix numerical indexing (rows) with named indexing of columns df[5:10, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;)] age wt 5 25 56 6 22 74 7 28 71 8 24 60 9 23 52 10 20 72 3.5.4.4 Double bracket and $ indexing of data frames Whereas single bracket indexing of a data frame always returns a new data frame, double bracket indexing and indexing using the $ operator, returns vectors. df[[&quot;age&quot;]] [1] 30 26 21 29 25 22 28 24 23 20 typeof(df[[&quot;age&quot;]]) [1] &quot;double&quot; df$wt [1] 88 76 67 66 56 74 71 60 52 72 typeof(df$wt) [1] &quot;double&quot; 3.5.5 Logical indexing of data frames Logical indexing using boolean values works on data frames in much the same way it works on vectors. Typically, logical indexing of a data frame is used to filter the rows of a data frame. For example, to get all the subject in our example data frame who are older than 25 we could do: # NOTE: the comma after 25 is important to insure we&#39;re indexing rows! df[df$age &gt; 25, ] age sex wt 1 30 M 88 2 26 F 76 4 29 F 66 7 28 M 71 Similarly, to get all the individuals whose weight is between 60 and 70 kgs we could do: df[(df$wt &gt;= 60 &amp; df$wt &lt;= 70),] age sex wt 3 21 M 67 4 29 F 66 8 24 F 60 3.5.6 Adding columns to a data frame Adding columns to a data frame is similar to adding items to a list. The easiest way to do so is using named indexing. For example, to add a new column to our data frame that gives the individuals ages in number of days, we could do: df[[&quot;age.in.days&quot;]] &lt;- df$age * 365 dim(df) [1] 10 4 "],

The idea behind literate statistical computing is that we should try to carry out our analyses in a manner that is transparent, self-explanatory, and reproducible. Literate statistical computing helps to ensure your research is reproducible because: The steps of your analyses are explicitly described, both as written text and the code and function calls used. Analyses can be more easily checked for correctness and reproduced from your literate code. Your literate code can serve as a template for future analyses, saving you time and the trouble of remembering all the gory details. As we’ll see, R Markdown will allow us to produce statistical documents that integrateprose, code, figures, and nicely formatted mathematics so that we can share and explain our analyses to others. Sometimes those “others” are advisors, supervisors, or collaborators; sometimes the other is you six months from now. For the purposes of this class, you will be asked to complete problem sets in the form of R Markdown documents. R Markdown documents are written in a light-weight markup language called Markdown. Markdown provides simple plain text “formatting” commands for specifying the structured elements of a document. Markdown was invented as a lightweight markup language for creating web pages and blogs, and has been adopted to a variety of different purposes. This hands-on provides a brief introduction to the capabilities of R Markdown. For more complete details, including lots of examples, see the R Markdown Website. 4.1 R Notebooks We’re going to create a type of R Markdown document called an “R Notebook”. The R Notebook Documentation describes R Notebooks as so: “An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with code chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.” 4.2 Creating an R Notebook To create an R Notebook select File &gt; New File &gt; R Notebook from the files menu in RStudio. Figure 4.1: Using the File menu to create a new R Notebook. 4.3 The default R Notebook template The standard template that RStudio creates for you includes a header section like the following where you can specify document properties such as the title, author, and change the look and feel of the generated HTML document. --- title: &quot;R Notebook&quot; output: html_notebook --- The header is followed by several example sections that illustrate a few of the capabilities of R Markdown. Delete these and replace them with your own code as necessary. 4.4 Code and Non-code blocks R Markdown documents are divided into code blocks (also called “chunks”) and non-code blocks. Code blocks are sets of R commands that will be evalauted when the R Markdown document is run or “knitted” (see below). Non-code blocks include explanatory text, embedded images, etc. The default notebook template includes both code and non-code blocks. 4.4.1 Non-code blocks The first bit of text in the default notebook template is a non-code block that tells you how to use the notebook: This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. The text of non-code blocks can include lightweight markup information that can be used to format HTML or PDF output generated from the R Markdown document. Here are some examples: # Simple textual formatting This is a paragraph with plain text. Nothing fancy will happen here. This is a second paragraph with *italic*, **bold**, and `verbatim` text. # Lists ## Bullet points lists This is a list with bullet points: * Item a * Item b * Item c ## Numbered lists This is a numbered list: 1. Item 1 #. Item 2 #. Item 3 ## Mathematics R Markdown supports mathematical equations, formatted according to LaTeX conventions. Dollar signs ($) are used to offset mathematics like so: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. Notice from the example above that R Markdown supports LaTeX style formatting of mathematical equations. For example, $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ appears as \\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\\). 4.4.2 Code blocks Code blocks are delimited by matching sets of three backward ticks (```). Everything within a code block is interpretted as an R command and is evaluated by the R interpretter. Here’s the first code block in the default notebook template: ```{r} plot(cars) ``` 4.5 Running a code chunk You can run a single code block by clicking the small green “Run” button in the upper right hand corner of the code block as shown in the image below. Figure 4.2: Click the Run button to execute a code chunk. If you click this button the commands within this code block are executed, and any generated output is shown below the code block. Try running the first code block in the default template now. After the code chunk is executed you should see a plot embedded in your R Notebook as shown below: Figure 4.3: An R Notebook showing an embedded plot after executing a code chunk. 4.6 Running all code chunks above Next to the “Run” button in each code chunk is a button for “Run all chunks above” (see figure below). This is useful when the code chunk you’re working on depends on calculations in earlier code chunks, and you want to evaluated those earlier code chunks prior to running the focal code chunk. Figure 4.4: Use the ‘Run all chunks above’ button to evaluate all previous code chunks. 4.7 “Knitting an” R Markdown to HTML Save your R Notebook as first_rnotebook.Rmd (RStudio will automatically add the .Rmd extension so you don’t need to type it). You can generate an HTML version of your notebook by clicking the “Preview” menu on the Notebook taskbar and then choosing “Knit to HTML” (see image below). Figure 4.5: Use the ‘Knit to HTML’ menu to generate HTML output from your R Notebook When an RMarkdown document is “knit”, all of the code and non-code blocks are executed in a “clean” environment, in order from top to bottom. An output file is generated (HTML or one of the other available output types) that shows the results of executing the notebook. By default RStudio will pop-up a window showing you the HTML output you generated. Knitting a document is a good way to make sure your analysis is reproducible. If your code compiles correctly when the document is knit, and produces the expected output, there’s a good chance that someone else will be able to reproduce your analyses independently starting with your R Notebook document (after accounting for differences in file locations). 4.8 Sharing your reproducible R Notebook To share your R Notebook with someone else you just need to send them the source R Markdown file (i.e. the file with the .Rmd extension). Assuming they have access to the same source data, another user should be able to open the notebook file in RStudio and regenerate your analyses by evaluating the individual code chunks or knitting the document. In this course you will be submitting homework assignments in the form of R Notebook markdown files. "],

For example, in a scatter plot we map two ordered sets of numbers (the variables of interest) to points in the Cartesian plane (x,y-coordinates). The representation of data as points in a plane can be thought of as a type of geometric mapping. In a histogram, we divide the range of a variable of interest into bins, count the number of observations in each bin, and represent those counts as bars. The process of counting the data in bins is a type of statistical transformation (summing in this case), while the representation of the counts as bars is another example of a geometric mapping. Both types of plots can be further embellished with additional information, such as coloring the points or bars based on a categorical variable of interest, changing the shape of points, etc. These are examples of aesthetic mappings. An additional operation that is frequently useful is faceting (also called conditioning), in which a series of subplots are created to show particular subsets of the data. The package ggplot2 is based on a formalized approach for building statistical graphics as a combination of geometric mappings, aesthetic mappings, statistical transformations, and faceting (conditioning). In ggplot2, complex figures are built up by combining layers – where each layer includes a geometric mapping, an aesthetic mapping, and a statistical transformation – along with any desired faceting information. Many of the key ideas behind ggplot2 (and its predecessor,“ggplot”) are based on a book called “The Grammar of Graphics” (Leland Wilkinson, 1985). The “grammar of graphics” is the “gg” in the ggplot2 name. 5.1 Loading ggplot2 ggplot2 is one of the packages included in the tidyverse meta-package we installed during the previous class session (see the previous lecture notes for instruction if you have not installed tidyverse). If we load the tidyverse package, ggplot2 is automatically loaded as well. library(tidyverse) However if we wanted to we could load only ggplot2 as follows: library(ggplot2) # not necessary if we already loaded tidyverse 5.2 Example data set: Anderson’s Iris Data To illustrate ggplot2 we’ll use a dataset called iris. This data set was made famous by the statistician and geneticist R. A. Fisher who used it to illustrate many of the fundamental statistical methods he developed (Recall that Fisher was one of the key contributors to the modern synthesis in biology, reconciling evolution and genetics in the early 20th century). The data set consists of four morphometric measurements for specimens from three different iris species (Iris setosa, I. versicolor, and I. virginica). Use the R help to read about the iris data set (?iris). We’ll be using this data set repeatedly in future weeks so familiarize yourself with it. The iris data is included in a standard R package (datasets) that is made available automatically when you start up R. As a consequence we don’t need to explicitly load the iris data from a file. Let’s take a few minutes to explore this iris data set before we start generating plots: names(iris) # get the variable names in the dataset [1] &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; [5] &quot;Species&quot; dim(iris) # dimensions given as rows, columns [1] 150 5 head(iris) # can you figure out what the head function does?

Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 145 6.7 3.3 5.7 2.5 virginica 146 6.7 3.0 5.2 2.3 virginica 147 6.3 2.5 5.0 1.9 virginica 148 6.5 3.0 5.2 2.0 virginica 149 6.2 3.4 5.4 2.3 virginica 150 5.9 3.0 5.1 1.8 virginica 5.3 Template for single layer plots in ggplot2 A basic template for building a single layer plot using ggplot2 is shown below. When creating a plot, you need to replace the text in brackets (e.g. &lt;DATA&gt;) with appropriate objects, functions, or arguments: # NOTE: this is pseudo-code. It will not run! ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) The base function ggplot() is responsible for creating the coordinate system in which the plot will be display. To this coordinate system we add a geometric mapping (called a “geom” for short) that specifies how data gets mapped into the coordinate system (e.g. points, bars, etc). Included as an input to the geom function is the aesthetic mapping function that specifies which variables to use in the geometric mapping (e.g. which variables to treat as the x- and y-coordinates), colors, etc. For example, using this template we can create a scatter plot that show the relationship between the variables Sepal.Width and Petal.Width. To do so we subsitute iris for &lt;DATA&gt;, geom_point for &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;, and x = Sepal.Width and y = Petal.Width for &lt;MAPPINGS&gt;. ggplot(data = iris) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width)) If we were to translate this code block to English, we might write it as “Using the iris data frame as the source of data, create a point plot using each observeration’s Sepal.Width variable for the x-coordinate and the Petal.Width variable for the y-coordinate.” 5.4 An aside about function arguments The inputs to a function are also known as “arguments”. In R, when you call a function you can specify the arguments by keyword (i.e. using names specified in the function definition) or by position (i.e. the order of the inputs). In our bar plot above, we’re using using keyword arguments. For example, in the line ggplot(data = iris), iris is treated as the “data” argument. Similarly, in the second line, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width) is the “mapping” argument to geom_bar. Note that aes is itself a function (see ?aes) that takes arguments that can be specified positionally or with keywords. If we wanted to, we could instead use position arguments when calling a function, by passing inputs to the function corresponding to the order they are specified in the function definition. For example, take a minute to read the documentation for the ggplot function (?ggplot). Near the top of the help page you’ll see a description of how the function is called under “Usage”. Reading the Usage section you’ll see that the the “data” argument is the first positional argument to ggplot. Similarly, if you read the docs for the geom_point function you’ll see that mapping is the first positional argument for that function. The equivalent of our previous example, but now using positional arguments is: ggplot(iris) + # note we dropped the &quot;data = &quot; part # note we dropped the &quot;mapping = &quot; part from the geom_point call geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width)) The upside of using positional arguments is that it means less typing, which is useful when working interactively at the console (or in an R Notebok). The downside to using positional arguments is you need to remember or lookup the order of the arguments. Using positional arguments can also make your code less “self documenting” in the sense that it is less explicit about how the inputs are being treated. While the argument “x” is the first argument to the aes function, I chose to explicitly include the argument name to make it clear what variable I’m plotting on the x-axis. We will cover function arguments in greater detail a class session or two from now, when we learn how to write our own functions. 5.5 Strip plots One of the simplest visualizations of a continuous variable is to draw points along a number line, where each point represent the value of one of the observations. This is sometimes called a “strip plot”. First, we’ll use the geom_point function as shown below to generate a strip plot for the Sepal.Width variable in the iris data set. ggplot(data = iris) + geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = 0)) 5.5.1 Jittering data There should have been 150 points plotted in the figure above (one for each of the iris plants in the data set), but visually it looks like only about 25 or 30 points are shown. What’s going on? If you examine the iris data, you’ll see that the all the measures are rounded to the nearest tenth of a centimer, so that there are a large number of observations with identical values of Sepal.Width. This is a limitation of the precision of measurements that was used when generating the data set. To provide a visual clue that there are multiple observations that share the same value, we can slightly “jitter” the values (randomly move points a small amount in either in the vertical or horizontal direction). Jittering is used solely to enhance visualization, and any statistical analyses you carry out would be based on the original data. When presenting your data to someone else, should note when you’ve used jittering so as not to misconvey the actual data. Jittering can be accomplished using geom_jitter, which is derived from geom_point: ggplot(data = iris) + geom_jitter(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = 0), width = 0.05, height = 0, alpha = 0.25) The width and height arguments specify the maximum amount (as fractions of the data) to jitter the observed data points in the horizontal (width) and vertical (height) directions. Here we only jitter the data in the horizontal direction. The alpha argument controls the transparency of the points – the valid range of alpha values is 0 to 1, where 0 means completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. Within a geom, arguments outside of the aes mapping apply uniformly across the visualization (i.e. they are fixed values). For example, setting `alpha = 0.25’ made all the points transparent. 5.5.2 Adding categorical information Recall that are three different species represented in the data: Iris setosa, I. versicolor, and I. virginica. Let’s see how to generate a strip plot that also includes a breakdown by species. ggplot(data = iris) + geom_jitter(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Species), width=0.05, height=0.1, alpha=0.5) That was easy! All we had to do was change the aesthetic mapping in geom_jitter, specifying “Species” as the y variable. I also added a little vertical jitter as well to better separate the points. Now we have a much better sense of the data. In particular it’s clear that the I. setosa specimens generally have wider sepals than samples from the other two species. Let’s tweak this a little by also adding color information, to further emphasize the distinct groupings. We can do this by adding another argument to the aesthetic mapping in geom_jitter. ggplot(data = iris) + geom_jitter(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Species, color=Species), width=0.05, height=0.1, alpha=0.5) 5.5.3 Rotating plot coordinates What if we wanted to rotate this plot 90 degrees, depicting species on the x-axis and sepal width on the y-axis. For this example, it would be easy to do this by simpling swapping the variables in the aes mapping argument. However an alternate way to do this is with a coordinate transformation function. Here we use coord_flip to flip the x- and y-axes: ggplot(data = iris) + geom_jitter(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Species, color=Species), width=0.05, height=0.1, alpha=0.5) + coord_flip() We’ll see other uses of coordinate transformations in later lectures. 5.6 Histograms Histograms are probably the most common way to depict univariate data. In a histogram rather than showing individual observations, we divide the range of the data into a set of bins, and use vertical bars to depict the number (frequency) of observations that fall into each bin. This gives a good sense of the intervals in which most of the observations are found. The geom, geom_histogram, takes care of both the geometric representation and the statistical transformations of the data necessary to calculate the counts in each binn. Here’s the simplest way to use geom_histogram: ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width)) `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. The default number of bins that geom_histogram uses is 30. For modest size data sets this is often too many bins, so it’s worth exploring how the histogram changes with different bin numbers: ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width), bins = 10) ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width), bins = 12) One important thing to note when looking at these histograms with different numbers of bins is that the number of bins used can change your perception of the data. For example, the number of peaks (modes) in the data can be very sensitive to the bin number as can the perception of gaps. 5.6.1 Variations on histograms when considering categorical data As before, we probably want to break the data down by species. Here we’re faced with some choices about how we depict that data. Do we generate a “stacked histogram” to where the colors indicate the number of observations in each bin that belong to each species? Do we generate side-by-side bars for each species? Or Do we generate separate histograms for each species, and show them overlapping? Stacked histograms are the default if we associate a categorical variable with the bar fill color: ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species), bins = 12) To get side-by-side bars, specify “dodge” as the position argument to geom_histogram. ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species), bins = 12, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) If you want overlapping histograms, use position = &quot;identity&quot; instead. When generating overlapping histograms like this, you probably want to make the bars semi-transparent so you can can distinguish the overlapping data. ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species), bins = 12, position = &quot;identity&quot;, alpha = 0.4) 5.7 Faceting to depict categorical information Yet another way to represent the histograms for the three species is to using faceting, the create subplots for each species. Faceting is the operation of subsetting the data with respect to a discrete or categorical variable of interest, and generating the same plot type for each subset. Here we use the “ncol” argument to the facet_wrap function to specify that the subplots should be drawn in a single vertical column to facilitate comparison of the distributions. ggplot(iris) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species), bins = 12) + facet_wrap(~Species, ncol = 1) 5.8 Density plots One shortcoming of histograms is that they are sensitive to the choice of bin margins and the number of bins. An alternative is a “density plot”, which you can think of as a smoothed version of a histogram. ggplot(iris) + geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species), alpha=0.25) Density plots still make some assumptions that affect the visualization, in particular a “smoothing bandwidth” (specified by the argument bw) which determines how course or granular the density estimation is. Note that the vertical scale on a density plot is no longer counts (frequency) but probability density. In a density plot, the total area under the plot adds up to one. Intervals in a density plot therefore have a probabilistic intepretation. 5.9 Violin or Beanplot A violin plot (sometimes called a bean plot) is closely related to a density plot. In fact you can think of a violin plot as a density plot rotated 90 degress and mirrored left/right. ggplot(iris) + geom_violin(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species, fill=Species), alpha = 0.25) 5.10 Boxplots Boxplots are another frequently used univariate visualization. Boxplots provide a compact summary of single variables, and are most often used for comparing distributions between groups. A standard box plot depicts five useful features of a set of observations: 1) the median (center most line); 2 and 3) the first and third quartiles (top and bottom of the box); 4) the whiskers of a boxplot extend from the first/third quartile to the highest value that is within 1.5 * IQR, where IQR is the inter-quartile range (distance between the first and third quartiles); 5) points outside of the whiskers are usually consider extremal points or outliers. There are many variants on box plots, particularly with respect to the “whiskers”. It’s always a good idea to be explicit about what a box plot you’ve created shows. ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) Boxplots are most commonly drawn with the cateogorical variable on the x-axis. 5.11 Building complex visualizations with layers All of our ggplot2 examples up to now have involved a single geom. We can think of geoms as “layers” of information in a plot. One of the powerful features of plotting useing ggplot2 is that it is trivial to combine layers to make more complex plots. The template for multi-layered plots is a simple extension of the single layer: ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION1&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION2&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) 5.12 Useful combination plots Boxplot or violin plots represent visual summaries/simplifications of the underlying data. This is useful but sometimes key information is lost in the process of summarizing. Combining these plots with a strip plot give you both the “birds eye view” as well as granular information. 5.12.1 Boxplot plus strip plot Here’s an example of combining box plots and strip plots: ggplot(iris) + # outlier.shape = NA suppresses the depiction of outlier points in the boxplot geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width), outlier.shape = NA) + # size sets the point size for the jitter plot geom_jitter(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width), width=0.2, height=0.05, alpha=0.35, size=0.75) Note that I suppressed the plotting of outliers in geom_boxplot so as not to draw the same points twice (the individual data are drawn by geom_jitter). 5.12.2 Setting shared aesthetics The example above works well, but you might have noticed that there’s some repetition of code. In particular, we set the same aesthetic mapping in both geom_boxplot and geom_jitter. It turns out that creating layers that share some of the same aesthetic values is a common case. To deal with such cases, you can specify shared aesthetic mappings as an argument to the ggplot function and then set additional aesthetics specific to each layer in the individual geoms. Using this approach, our previous example can be written more compactly as follow. ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # note how we specify a layer specific aesthetic in geom_jitter geom_jitter(aes(color = Species), width=0.2, height=0.05, alpha=0.5, size=0.75) 5.13 ggplot layers can be assigned to variables The function ggplot() returns a “plot object” that we can assign to a variable. The following example illustrates this: # create base plot object and assign to variable p # this does NOT draw the plot p &lt;- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width)) In the code above we created a plot object and assigned it to the variable p. However, the plot wasn’t drawn. To draw the plot object we evaluate it as so: p # try to draw the plot object The code block above didn’t generate an image, because we haven’t added a geom to the plot to determine how our data should be drawn. We can add a geom to our pre-created plot object as so: # add a point geom to our base layer and draw the plot p + geom_boxplot() If we wanted to we could have assigned the geom to a variable as well: box.layer &lt;- geom_boxplot() p + box.layer In this case we don’t really gain anything by creating an intermediate variable, but for more complex plots or when considering different versions of a plot this can be very useful. 5.13.1 Violin plot plus strip plot Here is the principle of combining layers, applied to a combined violin plot + strip plot. Again, we set shared aesthetic mappings in ggplot function call and this time we assign individual layers of the plot to variables. p &lt;- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) violin.layer &lt;- geom_violin() jitter.layer &lt;- geom_jitter(width=0.15, height=0.05, alpha=0.5, size=0.75) p + violin.layer + jitter.layer # combined layers of plot and draw 5.14 Adding titles and tweaking axis labels ggplot2 automatically adds axis labels based on the variable names in the data frame passed to ggplot. Sometimes these are appropriate, but more presentable figures you’ll usually want to tweak the axis labs (e.g. adding units). The labs (short for labels) function allows you to do so, and also let’s you set a title for your plot. We’ll illustrate this by modifying our previous figure. Note that we save considerable amounts of re-typing since we had already assigned three of the plot layers to variables in the previous code block: p + violin.layer + jitter.layer + labs(x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Width (cm)&quot;, title = &quot;Sepal Width Distributions for Three Iris Species&quot;) 5.15 ggplot2 themes By now you’re probably familiar with the default “look” of plots generated by ggplot2, in particular the ubiquitous gray background with a white grid. This default works fairly well in the context of RStudio notebooks and HTML output, but might not work as well for a published figure or a slide presentation. Almost every individual aspect of a plot can be tweaked, but ggplot2 provides an easier way to make consistent changes to a plot using “themes”. You can think of a theme as adding another layer to your plot. Themes should generally be applied after all the other graphical layers are created (geoms, facets, labels) so the changes they create affect all the prior layers. There are eight default themes included with ggplot2, which can be invoked by calling the corresponding theme functions: theme_gray, theme_bw, theme_linedraw, theme_light, theme_dark, theme_minimal, theme_classic, and theme_void (See http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html for a visual tour of all the default themes) For example, let’s generate a boxplot using theme_bw which get’s rid of the gray background: # create another variable to hold combination of three previous # ggplot layers. I&#39;m doing this because I&#39;m going to keep re-using # the same plot in the following code blocks violin.plus.jitter &lt;- p + violin.layer + jitter.layer violin.plus.jitter + theme_bw() Another theme, theme_classic, remove the grid lines completely, and also gets rid of the top-most and right-most axis lines. violin.plus.jitter + theme_classic() 5.15.1 Further customization with ggplot2::theme In addition to the eight complete themes, there is a theme function in ggplot2 that allows you to tweak particular elements of a theme (see ?theme for all the possible options). For example, to tweak just the aspect ratio of a plot (the ratio of width to height), you can set the aspect.ratio argument in theme: violin.plus.jitter + theme_classic() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) Theme related function calls can be combined to generate new themes. For example, let’s create a theme called my.theme by combining theme_classic with a call to theme: my.theme &lt;- theme_classic() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) We can then apply this theme as so: violin.plus.jitter + my.theme 5.16 Other aspects of ggplots can be assigned to variables Plot objects, geoms and themes are not the only aspects of a figure that can be assigned to variables for later use. For example, we can create a label object: my.labels &lt;- labs(x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Width (cm)&quot;, title = &quot;Sepal Width Distributions for Three Iris Species&quot;) Combining all of our variables as so, we generate our new plot: violin.plus.jitter + my.labels + my.theme 5.17 Bivariate plots Now we turn our attention to some useful representations of bivariate distributions. For the purposes of these illustrations I’m initially going to restrict my attention to just one of the three species represented in the iris data set – the I. setosa specimens. This allows us to introduce a vary useful base function called subset(). subset() will return subsets of a vector or data frames that meets the specified conditions. This can also be accomplished with conditional indexing but subset() is usually less verbose. # create a new data frame composed only of the I. setosa samples setosa.only &lt;- subset(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) In the examples that follow, I’m going to illustrate different ways of representing the same bivariate distribution – the joint distribution of Sepal Length and Sepal Width – over and over again. To avoid repitition, let’s assign the base ggplot layer to a variable as we did in our previous examples. We’ll also pre-create a label layer. setosa.sepals &lt;- ggplot(setosa.only, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) sepal.labels &lt;- labs(x = &quot;Sepal Length (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Width (cm)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between Sepal Length and Width&quot;, caption = &quot;data from Anderson (1935)&quot;) 5.17.1 Scatter plots A scatter plot is one of the simplest representations of a bivariate distribution. Scatter plots are simple to create in ggplot2 by specifying the appropriate X and Y variables in the aesthetic mapping and using geom_point for the geometric mapping. setosa.sepals + geom_point() + sepal.labels 5.18 Bivariate density plots The density plot, which we introduced as a visualization for univariate data, can be extended to two-dimensional data. In a one dimensional density plot, the height of the curve was related to the relatively density of points in the surrounding region. In a 2D density plot, nested contours (or contours plus colors) indicate regions of higher local density. Let’s illustrate this with an example: setosa.sepals + geom_density2d() + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme The relationship between the 2D density plot and a scatter plot can be made clearer if we combine the two: setosa.sepals + geom_density_2d() + geom_jitter(alpha=0.35) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme 5.19 Combining Scatter Plots and Density Plots with Categorical Information As with many of the univariate visualizations we explored, it is often useful to depict bivariate relationships as we change a categorical variable. To illustrate this, we’ll go back to using the full iris data set. all.sepals &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) all.sepals + geom_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species), size = 2, alpha = 0.6) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;All species&quot;) + my.theme Notice how in our aesthetic mapping we specified that both color and shape should be used to represent the species categories. The same thing can be accomplished with a 2D density plot. all.sepals + geom_density_2d(aes(color = Species)) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;All species&quot;) + my.theme As you can see, in the density plots above, when you have multiple categorical variables and there is significant overlap in the range of each sub-distribution, figures can become quite busy. As we’ve seen previously, faceting (conditioning) can be a good way to deal with this. Below a combination of scatter plots and 2D density plots, combined with faceting on the species variable. all.sepals + geom_density_2d(aes(color = Species), alpha = 0.5) + geom_point(aes(color = Species), alpha=0.5, size=1) + facet_wrap(~ Species) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;All species&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) # get rid of legend In this example I went back to using a theme that includes grid lines to facilitate more accurate comparisons of the distributions across the facets. I also got rid of the legend, because the information there was redundant. 5.20 Density plots with fill Let’s revisit our earlier single species 2D density plot. Instead of simply drawing contour lines, let’s use color information to help guide the eye to areas of higher density. To draw filled contours, we use a sister function to geom_density_2d called stat_density_2d: setosa.sepals + stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = &quot;polygon&quot;) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme Using the default color scale, areas of low density are drawn in dark blue, whereas areas of high density are drawn in light blue. I personally find this dark -to-light color scale non-intuitive for density data, and would prefer that darker regions indicate area of higher density. If we want to change the color scale, we can use the a scale function (in this case scale_fill_continuous) to set the color values used for the low and high values (this function we’ll interpolate the intervening values for us). NOTE: when specifying color names, R accepts standard HTML color names (see the Wikipedia page on web colors for a list). We’ll also see other ways to set color values in a later class session. setosa.sepals + stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = &quot;polygon&quot;) + # lavenderblush is the HTML standard name for a light purplish-pink color scale_fill_continuous(low=&quot;lavenderblush&quot;, high=&quot;red&quot;) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme The two contour plots we generated looked a little funny because the contours are cutoff due to the contour regions being outside the limits of the plot. To fix this, we can change the plot limits using the lims function as shown in the following code block. We’ll also add the scatter (jittered) to the emphasize the relationship between the levels, and we’ll change the title for the color legend on the right by specifying a text label associated with the fill arguments in the labs function. setosa.sepals + stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = &quot;polygon&quot;) + scale_fill_continuous(low=&quot;lavenderblush&quot;, high=&quot;red&quot;) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5, size = 1.1) + # customize labels, including legend label for fill labs(x = &quot;Sepal Length(cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Width (cm)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between sepal length and width&quot;, subtitle = &quot;I. setosa specimens only&quot;, fill = &quot;Density&quot;) + # Set plot limits lims(x = c(4,6), y = c(2.5, 4.5)) + my.theme 5.21 2D bin and hex plots Two dimensional bin and hex plots are alterative ways to represent the joint density of points in the Cartesian plane. Here are examples of to generate these plot types. Compare them to our previous examples. A 2D bin plot can be tought of as a 2D histogram: setosa.sepals + geom_bin2d(binwidth = 0.2) + scale_fill_continuous(low=&quot;lavenderblush&quot;, high=&quot;red&quot;) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme A hex plot is similar to a 2D bin plot but uses hexagonal regions instead of squares. Hexagonal bins are useful because they can somtimes avoid visual artefacts sometimes apparent with square bins: setosa.sepals + geom_hex(binwidth = 0.2) + scale_fill_continuous(low=&quot;lavenderblush&quot;, high=&quot;red&quot;) + sepal.labels + labs(subtitle = &quot;I. setosa data only&quot;) + my.theme 5.22 The cowplot package A common task when preparing visualizations for scientific presentations and manuscripts is combining different plots as subfigures of a larger figure. To accomplish this we’ll use a package called cowplot that compliments the power of ggplot2. Install cowplot either via the command line or the R Studio GUI (see Section 2.10). library(cowplot) # assumes package has been installed cowplot allows us to create individual plots using ggplot, and then arrange them in a grid-like fashion with labels for each plot of interest, as you would typically see in publications. The core function of cowplot is plot_grid(), which allows the user to layout the sub-plots in an organized fashion and add labels as necesary. To illustrate plot_grid() let’s create three different representations of the distribution of sepal width in the irisu data set, and combine them into a single figure: p &lt;- ggplot(iris, mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) # for the histogram we&#39;re going to override the mapping because # geom_histogram only takes an x argument plot.1 &lt;- p + geom_histogram(bins=12, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width), inherit.aes = FALSE) plot.2 &lt;- p + geom_boxplot() plot.3 &lt;- p + geom_violin() plot_grid(plot.1, plot.2, plot.3) If instead, we wanted to layout the plots in a single row we could change the call to plot_grid as so: plot_grid(plot.1, plot.2, plot.3, nrow = 1, labels = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)) Notice we also added labels to our sub-plots.

We will also explore in a little more depth the readr package, for reading tabular data. 6.1 Libraries Both readr and dplyr are members of the tidyverse, so a single invocation of library() makes the functions defined in these two packages available for our use: library(tidyverse) 6.2 Reading data with the readr package The readr package defines a number of functions for reading data tables from common file formats like Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) and Tab-Separated-Value (TSV) files. The two most frequently used readr functions we’ll use in this class are read_csv() and read_tsv() for reading CSV and TSV files respectively. There are some variants of these basic function, which you can read about by invoking the help system (?read_csv). 6.2.1 Example data: NC Births For today’s hands on session we’ll use a data set that contains information on 150 cases of mothers and their newborns in North Carolina in 2004. This data set is available at the following URL: https://github.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/raw/master/nc-births.txt The births data is a TSV file, so we’ll use the read_tsv() function to read it: births &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;https://github.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/raw/master/nc-births.txt&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( fAge = col_integer(), mAge = col_integer(), weeks = col_integer(), premature = col_character(), visits = col_integer(), gained = col_integer(), weight = col_double(), sexBaby = col_character(), smoke = col_character() ) Notice that when you used read_tsv() the function printed information about how it “parsed” the data (i.e. the types it assigned to each of the columns). The variables in the data set are: father’s age (fAge), mother’s age (mAge), weeks of gestation (weeks) whether the birth was premature or full term (premature) number of OB/GYN visits (visits) mother’s weight gained in pounds (gained) babies birth weight (weight) sex of the baby (sexBaby) whether the mother was a smoker (smoke). Notice too that we read the TSV file directly from a remote location via a URL. If instead, you wanted to load a local file on your computer you would specify the “path” – i.e. the location on your hard drive where you stored the file. For example, here is how I would load the same file if it was stored in the Downloads directory on my Mac laptop: # load the data from a local file births &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;/Users/pmagwene/Downloads/nc-births.txt&quot;) 6.2.2 Reading Excel files The tidyverse also includes a package called readxl which can be used to read Excel spreadsheets (recent versions with .xls and .xlsx extensions). Excel files are somewhat more complicated to deal with because they can include separate “sheets”. We won’t use readxl in this class, but documentation and examples of how readxl is used can be found at the page linked above. 6.3 A note on “tibbles” You may have noticed that most of the functions defined in tidyverse related packages return not data frames, but rather something called a “tibble”. You can think about tibbles as light-weight data frames. In fact if you ask about the “class” of a tibble you’ll see that it includes data.frame as one of it’s classes as well as tbl and tbl_df. class(births) [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; There are some minor differences between data frame and tibbles. For example, tibbles print differently in the console and don’t automatically change variable names and types in the same way that standard data frames do. Usually tibbles can be used wherever a standard data frame is expected, but you may occasionally find a function that only works with a standard data frame. It’s easy to convert a tibble to a standard data frame using the as.data.frame function: births.std.df &lt;- as.data.frame(births) For more details about tibbles, see the Tibbles chapter in R for Data Analysis. 6.4 Data filtering and transformation with dplyr dplyr is powerful tool for data filter and transformation. In the same way that ggplot2 attempts to provide a “grammar of graphics”, dplyr aims to provide a “grammar of data manipulation”. In today’s material we will see how dplyr complements and simplifies standard data frame indexing and subsetting operations. However, dplyr is focused only on data frames and doesn’t completely replace the basic subsetting operations, and so being adept with both dplyr and the indexing approaches we’ve seen previously is important. If you’re curious about the name “dplyr”, the package’s originator Hadley Wickham says it’s supposed to invoke the idea of pliers for data frames (Github: Meaning of dplyrs name) 6.5 dplyr’s “verbs” The primary functions in the dplyr package can be thought of as a set of “verbs”, each verb corresponding to a common data manipulation task. Some of the most frequently used verbs/functions in dplyr include: select – select columns filter – filter rows mutate – create new columns arrange– reorder rows summarize – summarize values group_by – split data frame on some grouping variable. Can be powerfully combined with summarize All of these functions return new data frames rather than modifying the existing data frame (though some of the functions support in place modification of data frames via optional arguments).We illustrate these below by example using the NC births data. 6.5.1 select The select function subsets the columns (variables) of a data frame. For example, to select just the weeks and weight columns from the births data set we could do: wks.weight &lt;- select(births, weeks, weight) dim(wks.weight) # dim should be 50 x 2 [1] 150 2 head(wks.weight) # A tibble: 6 x 2 weeks weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 39 6.88 2 39 7.69 3 40 8.88 4 40 9.00 5 40 7.94 6 40 8.25 The equivalent using standard indexing would be: wks.wt.alt &lt;- births[c(&quot;weeks&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;)] dim(wks.wt.alt) [1] 150 2 head(wks.wt.alt) # A tibble: 6 x 2 weeks weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 39 6.88 2 39 7.69 3 40 8.88 4 40 9.00 5 40 7.94 6 40 8.25 Notes: * The first argument to all of the dplyr functions is the data frame you’re operating on When using functions defined in dplyr and ggplot2 variable names are (usually) not quoted or used with the $ operator. This is a design feature of these libraries and makes it easier to carry out interactive analyes because it saves a fair amount of typing. 6.5.2 filter The filter function returns those rows of the data set that meet the given logical criterion. For example, to get all the premature babies in the data set we could use filter as so: premies &lt;- filter(births, premature == &quot;premie&quot;) dim(premies) [1] 21 9 The equivalent using standard indexing would be: premies.alt &lt;- births[births$premature == &quot;premie&quot;,] The filter function will work with more than one logical argument, and these are joined together using Boolean AND logic (i.e. intersection). For example, to find those babies that were premature and whose mothers were smokers we could do: smoking.premies &lt;- filter(births, premature == &quot;premie&quot;, smoke == &quot;smoker&quot;) The equivalent call using standard indexing is: # don&#39;t forget the trailing comma to indicate rows! smoking.premies.alt &lt;- births[(births$premature == &quot;premie&quot;) &amp; (births$smoke == &quot;smoker&quot;),] filter also accepts logical statements chained together using the standard Boolean operators. For example, to find babies who were premature or whose moms were older than 35 you could use the OR operator |: premies.or.oldmom &lt;- filter(births, premature == &quot;premie&quot; | fAge &gt; 35) 6.5.3 mutate The mutate function creates a new data frame that is the same as input data frame but with additional variables (columns) as specified by the function arguments. In the example below, I create two new variables, weight.in.kg and a mom.smoked: # to make code more readable it&#39;s sometime useful to spread out # function arguments over multiple lines like I&#39;ve done here births.plus &lt;- mutate(births, weight.in.kg = weight / 2.2, mom.smoked = (smoke == &quot;smoker&quot;)) head(births.plus) # A tibble: 6 x 11 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 31 30 39 full term 13 1 6.88 male smoker 2 34 36 39 full term 5 35 7.69 male nonsmoker 3 36 35 40 full term 12 29 8.88 male nonsmoker 4 41 40 40 full term 13 30 9.00 female nonsmoker 5 42 37 40 full term NA 10 7.94 male nonsmoker 6 37 28 40 full term 12 35 8.25 male smoker # ... with 2 more variables: weight.in.kg &lt;dbl&gt;, mom.smoked &lt;lgl&gt; The equivalent using standard indexing would be to create a new data frame from births, appending the new variables to the end as so: births.plus.alt &lt;- data.frame(births, weight.in.kg = births$weight / 2.2, mom.smoked = (births$smoke == &quot;smoker&quot;)) 6.5.4 arrange Arrange creates a new data frame where the rows are sorted according to their values for one or more variables. For example, to sort by mothers age we could do: young.moms.first &lt;- arrange(births, mAge) head(young.moms.first) # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 18 15 37 full term 12 76 8.44 male nonsmoker 2 NA 16 40 full term 4 12 6.00 female nonsmoker 3 21 16 38 full term 15 75 7.56 female smoker 4 26 17 38 full term 11 30 9.50 female nonsmoker 5 17 17 29 premie 4 10 2.63 female nonsmoker 6 20 17 40 full term 17 38 7.19 male nonsmoker The equivalent to arrange using standard indexing would be to use the information returned by the order function: young.moms.first.alt &lt;- births[order(births$mAge),] head(young.moms.first.alt) # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 18 15 37 full term 12 76 8.44 male nonsmoker 2 NA 16 40 full term 4 12 6.00 female nonsmoker 3 21 16 38 full term 15 75 7.56 female smoker 4 26 17 38 full term 11 30 9.50 female nonsmoker 5 17 17 29 premie 4 10 2.63 female nonsmoker 6 20 17 40 full term 17 38 7.19 male nonsmoker When using arrange, multiple sorting variables can be specified: sorted.by.moms.and.dads &lt;- arrange(births, mAge, fAge) head(sorted.by.moms.and.dads) # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 18 15 37 full term 12 76 8.44 male nonsmoker 2 21 16 38 full term 15 75 7.56 female smoker 3 NA 16 40 full term 4 12 6.00 female nonsmoker 4 17 17 29 premie 4 10 2.63 female nonsmoker 5 20 17 40 full term 17 38 7.19 male nonsmoker 6 26 17 38 full term 11 30 9.50 female nonsmoker If you want to sort in descending order, you can combing arrange with the desc (=descend) function, also defined in dplyr: old.moms.first &lt;- arrange(births, desc(mAge)) head(old.moms.first) # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 NA 41 33 premie 13 0 5.69 female nonsmoker 2 41 40 40 full term 13 30 9.00 female nonsmoker 3 33 40 36 premie 13 23 7.81 female nonsmoker 4 40 40 38 full term 13 38 7.31 male nonsmoker 5 46 39 38 full term 10 35 6.75 male smoker 6 NA 38 32 premie 10 16 2.19 female smoker 6.5.5 summarize summarize applies a function of interest to one or more variables in a data frame, reducing a vector of values to a single value and returning the results in a data frame. This is most often used to calculate statistics like means, medians, count, etc. As we’ll see below, this is powerful when combined with the group_by function. summarize(births, mean.wt = mean(weight), median.wks = median(weeks)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean.wt median.wks &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 7.05 39. You’ll need to be diligent if your data has missing values (NAs). For example, by default the mean function returns NA if any of the input values are NA: summarize(births, mean.gained = mean(gained)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean.gained &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA However, if you read the mean docs (?mean) you’ll see that there is an na.rm argument that indicates whether NA values should be removed before computing the mean. This is what we want so we instead call summarize as follows: summarize(births, mean.gained = mean(gained, na.rm = TRUE)) # A tibble: 1 x 1 mean.gained &lt;dbl&gt; 1 32.5 6.5.6 group_by The group_by function implicitly adds grouping information to a data frame. # group the births by whether mom smoked or not by_smoking &lt;- group_by(births, smoke) The object returned by group_by is a “grouped data frame”: class(by_smoking) [1] &quot;grouped_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Some functions, like count() and summarize() (see below) know how to use the grouping information. For example, to count the number of births conditional on mother smoking status we could do: count(by_smoking) # A tibble: 2 x 2 # Groups: smoke [2] smoke n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 nonsmoker 100 2 smoker 50 group_by also works with multiple grouping variables, with each added grouping variable specified as an additional argument: by_smoking.and.mAge &lt;- group_by(births, smoke, mAge &gt; 35) 6.5.7 Combining grouping and summarizing Grouped data frames can be combined with the summarize function we saw above. For example, if we wanted to calculate mean birth weight, broken down by whether the baby’s mother smoked or not we could call summarize with our by_smoking grouped data frame: summarize(by_smoking, mean.wt = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 2 x 2 smoke mean.wt &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 7.18 2 smoker 6.78 Similarly to get the mean birth weight of children conditioned on mothers smoking status and age: summarize(by_smoking.and.mAge, mean(weight)) # A tibble: 4 x 3 # Groups: smoke [?] smoke `mAge &gt; 35` `mean(weight)` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker FALSE 7.17 2 nonsmoker TRUE 7.26 3 smoker FALSE 6.83 4 smoker TRUE 6.30 6.5.8 Scoped variants of mutate and summarize Both the mutate() and summarize() functions provide “scoped” alternatives, that allow us to apply the operation on a selection of variables. These variants are often used in combination with grouping. We’ll look at the summarize versions – summarize_all(), summarize_at(), and summarize_if(). See the documentation (?mutate_all) for descriptions of the mutate versions. 6.5.8.1 summarize_all() summarize_all() applies a one or more functions to all columns in a data frame. Here we illustrate a simple version of this with the iris data: # group by species by_species &lt;- group_by(iris, Species) # calculate the mean of every variable, grouped by species summarize_all(by_species, mean) # A tibble: 3 x 5 Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 setosa 5.01 3.43 1.46 0.246 2 versicolor 5.94 2.77 4.26 1.33 3 virginica 6.59 2.97 5.55 2.03 Note that if we try and apply summarize_all() in the same way to the grouped data frame by_smoking we’ll get a bunch of warning messages: summarize_all(by_smoking, mean) # A tibble: 2 x 9 smoke fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker NA 26.9 38.6 NA NA NA 7.18 NA 2 smoker NA 26.0 38.5 NA 10.8 NA 6.78 NA Here’s an example of one of these warnings: Warning messages: 1: In mean.default(premature) : argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA This message is telling us that we can’t apply the mean() function to the data frame column premature because this is not a numerical or logical vector. Despite this and the other similar warnings, summarize_all() does return a result, but the means for any non-numeric values are replaced with NAs, as shown below: # A tibble: 2 x 9 smoke fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker NA 26.9 38.6 NA NA NA 7.18 NA 2 smoker NA 26.0 38.5 NA 10.8 NA 6.78 NA If you examine the output above, you’ll see that there are several variables that are numeric, however we still got NAs when we calculated the grouped means. This is because those variables contain NA values. The mean function has an optional argument, na.rm, which tells the function to remove any missing data before calculating the mean. Thus we can modify our call to summarize_all as follows: # calculate mean of all variables, grouped by smoking status summarize_all(by_smoking, mean, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 2 x 9 smoke fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 29.8 26.9 38.6 NA 11.9 32.5 7.18 NA 2 smoker 29.7 26.0 38.5 NA 10.8 32.3 6.78 NA Note that the non-numeric data columns still lead to NA values. 6.5.8.2 summarize_if() summarize_if() is similar to summarize_all(), except it only applies the function of interest to those variables that match a particular predicate (i.e. are TRUE for a particular TRUE/FALSE test). Here we use summarize_if() to apply the mean() function to only those variables (columns) that are numeric. # calculate mean of all numeric variables, grouped by smoking status summarize_if(by_smoking, is.numeric, mean, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 2 x 7 smoke fAge mAge weeks visits gained weight &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 29.8 26.9 38.6 11.9 32.5 7.18 2 smoker 29.7 26.0 38.5 10.8 32.3 6.78 6.5.8.3 summarize_at() summarize_at() allows us to apply functions of interest only to specific variables. # calculate mean of gained and weight variables, grouped by smoking status summarize_at(by_smoking, c(&quot;gained&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;), mean, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 2 x 3 smoke gained weight &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 32.5 7.18 2 smoker 32.3 6.78 All three of the scoped summarize functions can also be used to apply multiple functions, by wrapping the function names in a call to dplyr::funs(): # calculate mean and std deviation of # gained and weight variables, grouped by smoking status summarize_at(by_smoking, c(&quot;gained&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;), funs(mean, sd), na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 2 x 5 smoke gained_mean weight_mean gained_sd weight_sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 32.5 7.18 15.2 1.43 2 smoker 32.3 6.78 16.6 1.60 summarize_at() accepts as the the argument for variables a character vector of column names, a numeric vector of column positions, or a list of columns generated by the dplyr::vars() function, which can be be used as so: # reformatted to promote readability of arguments summarize_at(by_smoking, vars(gained, weight), funs(mean, sd), na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 2 x 5 smoke gained_mean weight_mean gained_sd weight_sd &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 nonsmoker 32.5 7.18 15.2 1.43 2 smoker 32.3 6.78 16.6 1.60 6.5.9 Combining summarize with grouping aesthetics in ggplot2 We’ve already seen an instance of grouping (conditioning) when we used aesthetics like color or fill to distinguish subgroups in different types of statistical graphics. Below is an example where we integrate information from a group_by/summarize operation into a plot: # calculate mean weights, conditioned on smoking status wt.by.smoking &lt;- summarize(by_smoking, mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) # create density plot for all the data # and then use geom_vline to draw vertical lines at the means for # each group ggplot(births) + geom_density(aes(x = weight, color = smoke)) + # data drawn from births geom_vline(data = wt.by.smoking, # note use of different data frame! mapping = aes(xintercept = mean_weight, color = smoke), linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;) 6.6 Pipes dplyr includes a very useful operator available called a pipe available to us. Pipes are powerful because they allow us to chain together sets of operations in a very intuitive fashion while minimizing nested function calls. We can think of pipes as taking the output of one function and feeding it as the first argument to another function call, where we’ve already specified the subsequent arguments. Pipes are actually defined in another packaged called magrittr. We’ll look at the basic pipe operator and then look at a few additional “special” pipes that magrittr provides. 6.6.1 Install and load magrittr In magrittr in not already installed, install it via the command line or the RStudio GUI. Having done so, you will need to load magrittr via the library() function: library(magrittr) 6.6.2 The basic pipe operator The pipe operator is designated by %&gt;%. Using pipes, the expression x %&gt;% f() is equivalent to f(x) and the expression x %&gt;% f(y) is equivalent to f(x,y). The documentation on pipes (see ?magrittr) uses the notation lhs %&gt;% rhs where lhs and rhs are short for “left-hand side” and “right-hand side” respectively. I’ll use this same notation in some of the explanations that follow. births %&gt;% head() # same as head(births) # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 31 30 39 full term 13 1 6.88 male smoker 2 34 36 39 full term 5 35 7.69 male nonsmoker 3 36 35 40 full term 12 29 8.88 male nonsmoker 4 41 40 40 full term 13 30 9.00 female nonsmoker 5 42 37 40 full term NA 10 7.94 male nonsmoker 6 37 28 40 full term 12 35 8.25 male smoker births %&gt;% head # you can even leave the parentheses out # A tibble: 6 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 31 30 39 full term 13 1 6.88 male smoker 2 34 36 39 full term 5 35 7.69 male nonsmoker 3 36 35 40 full term 12 29 8.88 male nonsmoker 4 41 40 40 full term 13 30 9.00 female nonsmoker 5 42 37 40 full term NA 10 7.94 male nonsmoker 6 37 28 40 full term 12 35 8.25 male smoker births %&gt;% head(10) # same as head(births, 10) # A tibble: 10 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 31 30 39 full term 13 1 6.88 male smoker 2 34 36 39 full term 5 35 7.69 male nonsmoker 3 36 35 40 full term 12 29 8.88 male nonsmoker 4 41 40 40 full term 13 30 9.00 female nonsmoker 5 42 37 40 full term NA 10 7.94 male nonsmoker 6 37 28 40 full term 12 35 8.25 male smoker 7 35 35 28 premie 6 29 1.63 female nonsmoker 8 28 21 35 premie 9 15 5.50 female smoker 9 22 20 32 premie 5 40 2.69 male smoker 10 36 25 40 full term 13 34 8.75 female nonsmoker Multiple pipes can be chained together, such that x %&gt;% f() %&gt;% g() %&gt;% h() is equivalent to h(g(f(x))). # equivalent to: head(arrange(births, weight), 10) births %&gt;% arrange(weight) %&gt;% head(10) # A tibble: 10 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 35 35 28 premie 6 29 1.63 female nonsmoker 2 NA 18 33 premie 7 40 1.69 male smoker 3 NA 38 32 premie 10 16 2.19 female smoker 4 17 17 29 premie 4 10 2.63 female nonsmoker 5 22 20 32 premie 5 40 2.69 male smoker 6 38 37 26 premie 5 25 3.63 male nonsmoker 7 25 22 34 premie 10 20 3.75 male nonsmoker 8 NA 24 38 full term 16 50 3.75 female nonsmoker 9 30 25 35 premie 15 40 4.50 male smoker 10 19 20 34 premie 13 6 4.50 male nonsmoker When there are multiple piping operations, I like to arrange the statements vertically to help emphasize the flow of processing and to facilitate debugging and/or modification. I would usually rearrange the above code block as follows: births %&gt;% arrange(weight) %&gt;% head(10) # A tibble: 10 x 9 fAge mAge weeks premature visits gained weight sexBaby smoke &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 35 35 28 premie 6 29 1.63 female nonsmoker 2 NA 18 33 premie 7 40 1.69 male smoker 3 NA 38 32 premie 10 16 2.19 female smoker 4 17 17 29 premie 4 10 2.63 female nonsmoker 5 22 20 32 premie 5 40 2.69 male smoker 6 38 37 26 premie 5 25 3.63 male nonsmoker 7 25 22 34 premie 10 20 3.75 male nonsmoker 8 NA 24 38 full term 16 50 3.75 female nonsmoker 9 30 25 35 premie 15 40 4.50 male smoker 10 19 20 34 premie 13 6 4.50 male nonsmoker 6.6.3 An example without pipes To illustrate how pipes help us, first let’s look at an example set of analysis steps without using pipes. Let’s say we wanted to explore the relationship between father’s age and baby’s birth weight. We’ll start this process of exploration by generating a bivariate scatter plot. Being good scientists we want to express our data in SI units, so we’ll need to converts pounds to kilograms. You’ll also recall that a number of the cases have missing data on father’s age, so we’ll want to remove those before we plot them. Here’s how we might accomplish these steps: # add a new column for weight in kg births.kg &lt;- mutate(births, weight.kg = weight / 2.2) # filter out the NA fathers filtered.births &lt;- filter(births.kg, !is.na(fAge)) # create our plot ggplot(filtered.births, aes(x = fAge, y = weight.kg)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Father&#39;s Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Birth Weight (kg)&quot;) Notice that we created two “temporary” data frames along the way – births.kg and filtered.births. These probably aren’t of particular interest to us, but we needed to generate them to build the plot we wanted. If you were particularly masochistic you could avoid these temporary data frames by using nested functions call like this: # You SHOULD NOT write nested code like this. # Code like this is hard to debug and understand! ggplot(filter(mutate(births, weight.kg = weight / 2.2), !is.na(fAge)), aes(x = fAge, y = weight.kg)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Father&#39;s Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Birth Weight (kg)&quot;) 6.6.4 The same example using pipes The pipe operator makes the output of one statement (lhs) as the first input of a following function (rhs). This simplifies the above example to: births %&gt;% mutate(weight.kg = weight / 2.2) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(fAge)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = fAge, y = weight.kg)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Father&#39;s Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Birth Weight (kg)&quot;) In the example above, we feed the data frame into the mutate function. mutate expects a data frame as a first argument, and subsequent arguments specify the new variables to be created. births %&gt;% mutate(weight.kg = weight / 2.2) is thus equivalent to mutate(births, weight.kg = weight / 2.2)). We then pipe the output to filter, removing NA fathers, and then pipe that output as the input to ggplot. As mentioned previously, it’s good coding style to write each discrete step as its own line when using piping. This make it easier to understand what the steps of the analysis are as well as facilitating changes to the code (commenting out lines, adding lines, etc) 6.6.5 Assigning the output of a statement involving pipes to a variable It’s important to recognize that pipes are simply a convenient way to chain together a series of expression. Just like any other compound expression, the output of a series of pipe statements can be assigned to a variable, like so: stats.old.moms &lt;- births %&gt;% filter(mAge &gt; 35) %&gt;% summarize(median.gestation = median(weeks), mean.weight = mean(weight)) stats.old.moms # A tibble: 1 x 2 median.gestation mean.weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 38 6.94 Note that our summary table, stats.old.moms, is itself a data frame. 6.6.6 Compound assignment pipe operator A fairly common operation when working interactively in R is to update an existing data frame. magrittr defines another pipe operator – %&lt;&gt;% – called the “compound assignment” pipe operator, to facilitate this. The compound assignment pipe operator has the basic usage lhs %&lt;&gt;% rhs. This operator evaluates the function on the rhs using the lhs as the first argument, and then updates the lhs with the resulting value. This is simply shorthand for writing lhs &lt;- lhs %&gt;% rhs. stats.old.moms %&lt;&gt;% # note compound pipe operator! mutate(mean.weight.kg = mean.weight / 2.2) 6.6.7 The dot operator with pipes When working with pipes, sometimes you’ll want to use the lhs in multiple places on the rhs, or as something other than the first argument to the rhs. magrittr provides for this situation by using the dot (.) operator as a placeholder. Using the dot operator, the expression y %&gt;% f(x, .) is equivalent to f(x,y). c(&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cakes&quot;, &quot;sauce&quot;, &quot;house&quot;) %&gt;% # create a vector sample(1) %&gt;% # pick a random single element of that vector str_c(&quot;hot&quot;, .) # string concatenate the pick with the word &quot;hot&quot; [1] &quot;hotcakes&quot; 6.6.8 The exposition pipe operator magrittr defines another operator called the “exposition pipe operator”, designed %$%. This operator exposes the names in the lhs to the expression on the rhs. Here is an example of using the exposition pipe operator to simply return the vector of weights: births %&gt;% filter(premature == &quot;premie&quot;) %$% # note the different pipe operator! weight [1] 1.63 5.50 2.69 6.50 7.81 4.75 3.75 2.19 6.81 4.69 6.75 4.50 5.94 4.50 [15] 5.06 5.69 1.69 6.31 2.63 5.88 3.63 If we wanted to calculate the minimum and maximum weight of premature babies in the data set we could do the following (though I’d usually prefer summarize() unless I needed the results in the form of a vector): births %&gt;% filter(mAge &gt; 35) %$% # note the different pipe operator! c(min(weight), max(weight)) [1] 2.19 10.13 "],

This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, the data may have been recorded in a manner convenient for collection and visual inspection, but which does not work well for analysis and plotting. Or the data may be an amalgamation of multiple experiments, in which each of the experimenters used slightly different naming conventions. Or the data may have been produced by an instrument that produces output with a fixed format. Sometimes important experimental information is included in the column headers of a spreadsheet. Whatever the case, we often find ourselves in the situation where we need to “wrangle” our data into a “tidy” format before we can proceed with visualization and analysis. The “R for Data Science” text discusses some desirable rules for “tidy” data in order to facilitate downstream analyses. These are: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. In this lecture we’re going to walk through an extended example of wrangling some data into a “tidy” format. 7.1 Libraries library(magrittr) library(stringr) library(tidyverse) library(cowplot) 7.2 Data To illustrate a standard data wrangling pipeline, we’re going to use a gene expression microarray data set, based on the following paper: Spellman PT, et al. 1998. Comprehensive identification of cell cycle-regulated genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by microarray hybridization. Mol Biol Cell 9(12): 3273-97. In this paper, Spellman and colleagues tried to identify all the genes in the yeast genome (&gt;6000 genes) that exhibited oscillatory behaviors suggestive of cell cycle regulation. To do so, they combined gene expression measurements from six different types of cell cycle synchronization experiments. Download the Spellman data to your filesystem from this link (right-click the “Download” button and save to your Downloads folder or similar). I suggest that once you download the data, you open it in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) or use the RStudio Data Viewer to get a sense of what the data looks like. Let’s load it into R, using the read_tsv() function, using the appropriate file path. # the filepath may differ on your computer spellman &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;~/Downloads/spellman-combined.txt&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_double(), X1 = col_character(), clb = col_character(), alpha = col_character(), cdc15 = col_character(), cdc28 = col_character(), elu = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. The initial dimenions of the data frame are: dim(spellman) [1] 6178 83 The six types of cell cycle synchronization experiments are: synchronization by alpha-factor = “alpha” synchronization by cdc15 temperature sensitive mutants = “cdc15” synchronization by cdc28 temperature sensitive mutants = “cdc28” synchronization by elutration = “elu” synchronization by cln3 mutatant strains = “cln3” synchronization by clb2 mutant strains = “clb2” 7.3 Renaming data frame columms Notice that when we imported the data we got a warning message: Missing column names filled in: 'X1' [1]. In a data frame, every column must have a name. The first column of our data set did not have a name in the header, so read_tsv automatically gave it the name X1. Our first task is to give the first column a more meaningful name. This column gives “systematic gene names” – a standardized naming scheme for genes in the yeast genome. We’ll use dplyr::rename to do rename X1 to gene. Note that rename can take multiple arguments if you need to rename multiple columns simultaneously. spellman.clean &lt;- spellman %&gt;% rename(gene = X1) 7.4 Dropping unneeded columns Take a look at the Spellman data again in your spreadsheet program (or the R Studio data viewer). You’ll notice there are some blank columns. These are simply visual organizing elements that the creator of the spreadsheet added to separate the different experiments that are included in the data set. We can use dplyr::select to drop columns by prependingcolumn names with the negative sign: # drop the alpha column keeping all others spellman.clean %&lt;&gt;% select(-alpha) Note that usually select() keeps only the variables you specify. However if the first expression is negative, select will instead automatically keep all variables, dropping only those you specify. 7.4.1 Finding all empty columns In the example above, we looked at the data and saw that the “alpha” column was empty, and thus dropped it. This worked because there are only a modest number of columns in the data frame in it’s initial form. However, if our data frame contained thousands of columns, this “look and see” procedure would not be efficient. Can we come up with a general solution for removing empty columns from a data frame? When you load a data frame from a spreadsheet, empty cells are given the value NA. In previous class sessions we were introduced to the function is.na() which tests each value in a vector or data frame for whether it’s NA or not. We can count NA values in a vector by summing the output of is.na(). Conversely we can count the number of “not NA” items by using the negation operator (!): # count number of NA values in the alpha0 column sum(is.na(spellman$alpha0)) [1] 165 # count number of values that are NOT NA in alpha0 sum(!is.na(spellman$alpha0)) [1] 6013 This seems like it should get us close to a solution but sum(is.na(..)) when applied to a data frame counts NAs across the entire data frame, not column-by-column. # doesn&#39;t do what we hoped! sum(is.na(spellman)) [1] 59017 If we want sums of NAs by column, we instead use the colSums() function: # get number of NAs by column colSums(is.na(spellman)) X1 cln3-1 cln3-2 clb clb2-2 clb2-1 alpha 0 193 365 6178 454 142 6178 alpha0 alpha7 alpha14 alpha21 alpha28 alpha35 alpha42 165 525 191 312 267 207 123 alpha49 alpha56 alpha63 alpha70 alpha77 alpha84 alpha91 257 147 186 185 178 155 329 alpha98 alpha105 alpha112 alpha119 cdc15 cdc15_10 cdc15_30 209 174 222 251 6178 677 477 cdc15_50 cdc15_70 cdc15_80 cdc15_90 cdc15_100 cdc15_110 cdc15_120 501 608 573 562 606 570 611 cdc15_130 cdc15_140 cdc15_150 cdc15_160 cdc15_170 cdc15_180 cdc15_190 495 574 811 583 571 803 613 cdc15_200 cdc15_210 cdc15_220 cdc15_230 cdc15_240 cdc15_250 cdc15_270 1014 573 741 596 847 379 537 cdc15_290 cdc28 cdc28_0 cdc28_10 cdc28_20 cdc28_30 cdc28_40 426 6178 122 72 67 55 66 cdc28_50 cdc28_60 cdc28_70 cdc28_80 cdc28_90 cdc28_100 cdc28_110 56 82 84 75 237 165 319 cdc28_120 cdc28_130 cdc28_140 cdc28_150 cdc28_160 elu elu0 312 1439 2159 521 543 6178 122 elu30 elu60 elu90 elu120 elu150 elu180 elu210 153 175 132 103 119 111 118 elu240 elu270 elu300 elu330 elu360 elu390 131 110 112 112 156 114 Columns with all missing values can be more conveniently found by asking for those columns where the number of “not missing” values is zero: # get names of all columns for which all rows are NA # useing standard indexing names(spellman)[colSums(!is.na(spellman)) == 0] [1] &quot;clb&quot; &quot;alpha&quot; &quot;cdc15&quot; &quot;cdc28&quot; &quot;elu&quot; We can combine the colSums(!is.na()) idiom with the dplyr::select_if function to quickly remove all empty columns as so: spellman.clean %&lt;&gt;% # keep ONLY the non-empty columns select_if(colSums(!is.na(.)) &gt; 0) 7.4.2 Dropping columns by matching names Only two time points from the cln3 and clb2 experiments were reported in the original publication. Since complete time series are unavailable for these two experimental conditions we will drop them from further consideration. select() can be called be called with a number of “helper function” (?select_helpers). Here we’ll illustrate the matches() helper function which matches column names to a “regular expression”. Regular expressions (also referred to as “regex” or “regexp”) are a way of specifying patterns in string. For the purposes of this document we’ll illustrate regexs by example; for a more detailed explanation of regular expressions see the the regex help(?regex) and the Chapter on Strings in “R for Data Analysis”: Let’s see how to drop all the “cln3” and “clb2” columns from the data frame using matches(): spellman.clean %&lt;&gt;% select(-matches(&quot;cln3&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-matches(&quot;clb2&quot;)) If we wanted we could have collapsed our two match statements into one as follows: spellman.clean %&lt;&gt;% select(-matches(&quot;cln3|clb2&quot;)) In this second example, the character “|” is specifing an OR match within the regular expression, so this regular expression matches column names that contain “cln3” OR “clb2”. 7.5 Reshaping data with tidyr The tidyr package provides functions for reshaping or tidying data frames. tidyr is yet another component of the tidyverse, and thus was loaded by the library(tidyverse). Today we’re going to look at two functions tidyr::gather() and tidyr::extract(), and how they can be combined with now familiar dplyr functions we’ve seen previously. The reading assignment for today’s class session covers a variety of other functions defined in tidyr. The Spellman data, as I provided it to you, is in what we would call “wide” format. Each column (besides the gene column) corresponds to an experimental condition and time point. For example, “alpha0” is the alpha-factor experiment at time point 0 mins; “alpha7” is the alpha-factor experiment at time point 7 mins, etc. The cells within each column correspond to the expression of a corresponding gene (given by the first column which we renamed gene) in that particular experiment at that particular time point. In every column (except “gene”), the cellsrepresents the same abstract property of interest – the expression of a gene of interest in a particular experiment/time point. Our first task will be to rearrange our “wide” data frame that consists of many different columns representing gene expression into a “long” data frame with just a single column representing expression. We’ll also create a new column to keep track of the which experiment and time point the measurement came from. 7.5.1 Wide to long conversions using tidyr::gather tidyr::gather() takes multiple columns, and collapses them together into a smaller number of new columns. When using gather() you give the names of the new columns to create, as well as the names of any existing columns gather should not collect together. Here we want to collapse all 73 or the expression columns – “alpha0” to “elu390” – into two columns: 1) a column to represent the expt/time point of the measurement, and 2) a column to represent the corresponding expression value. The only column we don’t want to touch is the gene column with our gene names. # convert &quot;wide&quot; data to &quot;long&quot; spellman.long &lt;- spellman.clean %&gt;% gather(expt.and.time, expression, -gene) Take a moment to look at the data in the “long format”: head(spellman.long) # A tibble: 6 x 3 gene expt.and.time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha0 -0.150 2 YAL002W alpha0 -0.110 3 YAL003W alpha0 -0.140 4 YAL004W alpha0 -0.0200 5 YAL005C alpha0 -0.0500 6 YAL007C alpha0 -0.600 And compare the dimensions of the wide data to the new data: dim(spellman.clean) # for comparison [1] 6178 74 dim(spellman.long) [1] 450994 3 As you see, we’ve gone from a data frame with 6178 rows and 74 columns (wide format), to a new data frame with 450994 rows and 3 columns (long format). 7.5.2 Extracting information from combined variables using tidyr::extract The column expt.and.time violates one of our principles of tidy data: “Each variable must have its own column.”. This column conflates two different types of information – the experiment type and the time point of the measurement. Our next task is to split this information up into two new variables, which will help to facilitate downstream plotting and analysis. One complicating factor is that the different experiments/time combinations have different naming conventions: The “alpha” and “elu” experiments are of the form “alpha0”, “alpha7”, “elu0”, “elu30”, etc. In this case, the first part of the string gives the experiment type (either alpha or elu) and the following digits give the time point. In the “cdc15” and “cdc28” experiments the convention is slightly different; they are of the form “cdc15_0”, “cdc15_10”, “cdc28_0”, “cdc28_10”, etc. Here the part of the string before the underscore gives the experiment type, and the digits after the underscore give the time point. Because of the differences in naming conventions, we will find it easiest to break up spellman.long into a series of sub-data sets corresponding to each experiment type in order to extract out the experiment and time information. After processing each data subset separately, we will join the modified sub-data frames back together. 7.5.3 Subsetting rows Let’s start by getting just the rows corresponding to the “alpha” experiment/times. Here we use dplyr::filter in combination with stringr::str_detect to get all those rows in which the expt.and.time variable contains the string “alpha”. alpha.long &lt;- spellman.long %&gt;% filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, &quot;alpha&quot;)) # look at the new data frame dim(alpha.long) [1] 111204 3 head(alpha.long, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 3 gene expt.and.time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha0 -0.150 2 YAL002W alpha0 -0.110 3 YAL003W alpha0 -0.140 4 YAL004W alpha0 -0.0200 5 YAL005C alpha0 -0.0500 6 YAL007C alpha0 -0.600 7 YAL008W alpha0 -0.280 8 YAL009W alpha0 -0.0300 9 YAL010C alpha0 -0.0500 10 YAL011W alpha0 -0.310 7.5.4 Splitting columns Having subsetted the data, we can now split expt.and.time into two new variables – expt and time. To do this we use tidyr::extract. alpha.long %&lt;&gt;% tidyr::extract(expt.and.time, # column we&#39;re extracting from c(&quot;expt&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), # new columns we&#39;re creating regex=&quot;(alpha)([[:digit:]]+)&quot;, # regexp (see below) convert=TRUE) # automatically convert column types # NOTE: I&#39;m being explict about saying tidyr::extract because the # magrittr package defines a different extract function Let’s take a moment to look at the regex argument to extract – regex=&quot;(alpha)([[:digit:]]+)&quot;. The regex is specified as a character string. Each part we want to match and extract is surround by parentheses. In this case we have two sets of parentheses corresponding to the two matches we want to make. The first part of the regex is (alpha); here we’re looking to make an exact match to the string “alpha”. The second part of the regex reads ([[:digit:]]+). [[:digit:]] indicates we’re looking for a numeric digit. The + after [[:digit:]] indicates that we want to match one or more digits (i.e. to get a match we need to find at least one digit, but more than one digit should also be a match). Let’s take a look at the new version of alpha.long following application of extract: head(alpha.long, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 4 gene expt time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha 0 -0.150 2 YAL002W alpha 0 -0.110 3 YAL003W alpha 0 -0.140 4 YAL004W alpha 0 -0.0200 5 YAL005C alpha 0 -0.0500 6 YAL007C alpha 0 -0.600 7 YAL008W alpha 0 -0.280 8 YAL009W alpha 0 -0.0300 9 YAL010C alpha 0 -0.0500 10 YAL011W alpha 0 -0.310 Notice our two new variables, both of which have appropriate types! A data frame for the elutriation data can be created similarly: elu.long &lt;- spellman.long %&gt;% filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, &quot;elu&quot;)) %&gt;% tidyr::extract(expt.and.time, # column we&#39;re extracting from c(&quot;expt&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), # new columns we&#39;re creating regex=&quot;(elu)([[:digit:]]+)&quot;, # regexp (see below) convert=TRUE) # automatically convert column types 7.5.4.1 A fancier regex for the cdc experiments Now let’s process the cdc experiments (cdc15 and cdc28). As before we extract the corresponding rows of the data frame using filter and str_detect. We then split expt.and.time using tidyr::extract. In this case we carry out the two steps in a single code block using pipes: cdc.long &lt;- spellman.long %&gt;% # both cdc15 and cdc28 contain &quot;cdc&quot; as a sub-string filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, &quot;cdc&quot;)) %&gt;% tidyr::extract(expt.and.time, c(&quot;expt&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), regex=&quot;(cdc15|cdc28)_([[:digit:]]+)&quot;, # note the fancier regex convert=TRUE) The regex – &quot;(cdc15|cdc28)_([[:digit:]]+)&quot; – is slightly fancier in this example. As before there are two parts we’re extracting: (cdc15|cdc28) and ([[:digit:]]+). The first parenthesized regexp is an “OR” – i.e. match “cdc15” or “cdc28”. The second parenthesized regexp is the same as we saw previously. Separating the two parenthesized regexps is an underscore (_). The underscore isn’t parenthesized because we only want to use it to make a match not to extract the corresponding match. 7.5.5 Combining data frame rows If you have two or more data frames with identical columns, the rows of the data frame can be combined using rbind (defined in the base package). For example, to reassemble the alpha.long, elu.long, and cdc.long data frames into a single data frame we do: spellman.final &lt;- rbind(alpha.long, elu.long, cdc.long) # check the dimensions of the new data frame dim(spellman.final) [1] 450994 4 7.5.6 Sorting data frame rows Currently the spellman.final data frame is sorted by time point and experiment. head(spellman.final, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 4 gene expt time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha 0 -0.150 2 YAL002W alpha 0 -0.110 3 YAL003W alpha 0 -0.140 4 YAL004W alpha 0 -0.0200 5 YAL005C alpha 0 -0.0500 6 YAL007C alpha 0 -0.600 7 YAL008W alpha 0 -0.280 8 YAL009W alpha 0 -0.0300 9 YAL010C alpha 0 -0.0500 10 YAL011W alpha 0 -0.310 It might be useful instead to sort by gene and experiment. To do this we can use dplyr::arrange: spellman.final %&lt;&gt;% arrange(gene, expt) # look again at the rearranged data head(spellman.final, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 4 gene expt time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha 0 -0.150 2 YAL001C alpha 7 -0.150 3 YAL001C alpha 14 -0.210 4 YAL001C alpha 21 0.170 5 YAL001C alpha 28 -0.420 6 YAL001C alpha 35 -0.440 7 YAL001C alpha 42 -0.150 8 YAL001C alpha 49 0.240 9 YAL001C alpha 56 -0.100 10 YAL001C alpha 63 NA 7.5.7 Collapsing columns using tidyr::unite unite combines the data from multiple columns into one, separating the column data with a consistent separator character (the underscore character “_&quot; by default). For example, if we wanted to combined the experiment and time columns again (recall that we previously separated with with extract) we could do: spellman.recombined &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% unite(expt.and.time, expt, time) # give new column name first # then give columns to combine dim(spellman.recombined) [1] 450994 3 head(spellman.recombined, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 3 gene expt.and.time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha_0 -0.150 2 YAL001C alpha_7 -0.150 3 YAL001C alpha_14 -0.210 4 YAL001C alpha_21 0.170 5 YAL001C alpha_28 -0.420 6 YAL001C alpha_35 -0.440 7 YAL001C alpha_42 -0.150 8 YAL001C alpha_49 0.240 9 YAL001C alpha_56 -0.100 10 YAL001C alpha_63 NA 7.5.8 Splitting columns using tidyr::separate separate splits a column into multiple columns. It’s very much like extract except that it only takes a single regex for the separator, which by default is any non-alphabetic or non-numeric character. For example, to re-split expt.and.time in spellman.recombined we could do: spellman.respread &lt;- spellman.recombined %&gt;% separate(expt.and.time, c(&quot;expt&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), convert = TRUE) dim(spellman.respread) [1] 450994 4 head(spellman.respread,n= 10) # A tibble: 10 x 4 gene expt time expression &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YAL001C alpha 0 -0.150 2 YAL001C alpha 7 -0.150 3 YAL001C alpha 14 -0.210 4 YAL001C alpha 21 0.170 5 YAL001C alpha 28 -0.420 6 YAL001C alpha 35 -0.440 7 YAL001C alpha 42 -0.150 8 YAL001C alpha 49 0.240 9 YAL001C alpha 56 -0.100 10 YAL001C alpha 63 NA Faced with the task of splitting columns, try tidyr::separate first and only consider tidyr::extract if you need to defines more sophisticated rules for splitting. 7.5.9 Long-to-wide conversion using tidyr::spread tidyr::spread is the inverse of tidyr::gather. gather() took multiple columns and collapsed them together into a smaller number of new columns. The tidyr documentation calls this “collapsing into key-value pairs”. By contrast, spread() creates new columns by spreading “key-value pairs” (a column representing the “keys” and a column reprsenting the “values”) into multiple columns. Here let’s use spread to use the gene names (the “key”) and expression measures (the “values”) to create a new data frame where the genes are the primary variables (columns) of the data. spellman.gene.focused &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% spread(gene, expression) dim(spellman.gene.focused) [1] 73 6180 Both “long” and “wide” tidy versions of the same data are useful, depending on the specific analyses and/or visualiztions you want to accomplish. We’ll look at applications of both in the sections that follow. 7.6 Using your tidy data Whew – that was a fair amount of work to tidy our data! But having done so we can now carry out a wide variety of very powerful analyses. 7.6.1 Visualizing gene expression time series Let’s start by walking through a series of visualizations of gene expression time series. Each plot will show the expression of one or more genes, at different time points, in one or more experimental conditions. Our initial visualizations exploit the “long” versions of the tidy data. First a single gene in a single experimental condition: spellman.final %&gt;% filter(expt == &quot;alpha&quot;, gene == &quot;YAL022C&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Expression of YAL022C&quot;) We can easily modify the above code block to visualize the expression of multiple genes of interest: genes.of.interest &lt;- c(&quot;YAL022C&quot;, &quot;YAR018C&quot;, &quot;YGR188C&quot;) spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest, expt == &quot;alpha&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Normalized expression&quot;, title = &quot;Expression of multiple genes\\nfollowing synchronization by alpha factor&quot;) By employing facet_wrap() we can visualize the relationship between this set of genes in each of the experiment types: spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ expt) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Normalized expression&quot;, title = &quot;Expression of Multiple Genes\\nAcross experiments&quot;) The different experimental treatments were carried out for varying lengths of time due to the differences in their physiological effects. Plotting them all on the same time scale can obscure that patterns of oscillation we might be interested in, so let’s modify our code block so that plots that share the same y-axis, but have differently scaled x-axes. spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Normalized expression&quot;, title = &quot;Expression of Multiple Genes\\nAcross experiments&quot;) 7.6.2 Finding the most variable genes When dealing with vary large data sets, one ad hoc filtering criteria that is often employed is to focus on those variables that exhibit that greatest variation. To do this, we first need to order our variables (genes) by their variation. Let’s see how we can accomplish this using our long data frame: by.variance &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% group_by(gene) %&gt;% summarize(expression.var = var(expression, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(expression.var)) head(by.variance) # A tibble: 6 x 2 gene expression.var &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YLR286C 2.16 2 YNR067C 1.73 3 YNL327W 1.65 4 YGL028C 1.57 5 YHL028W 1.52 6 YKL164C 1.52 The code above calculates variance but ignores the fact that we have different experimental conditions. To take into account the experimental design of the data at hand, let’s calculate the average variance across the experimental conditions: by.avg.variance &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% group_by(gene, expt) %&gt;% summarize(expression.var = var(expression, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% group_by(gene) %&gt;% summarize(avg.expression.var = mean(expression.var)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(avg.expression.var)) head(by.avg.variance) # A tibble: 6 x 2 gene avg.expression.var &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 YFR014C 3.58 2 YFR053C 2.38 3 YBL032W 2.30 4 YDR274C 2.17 5 YLR286C 2.13 6 YMR206W 1.94 Based on the average experession variance across experimental conditions, let’s get the names of the 1000 most variable genes: top.genes.1k &lt;- by.avg.variance[1:1000,]$gene head(top.genes.1k) [1] &quot;YFR014C&quot; &quot;YFR053C&quot; &quot;YBL032W&quot; &quot;YDR274C&quot; &quot;YLR286C&quot; &quot;YMR206W&quot; 7.6.3 Exploring bivariate relationships using “wide” data The “long” version of our data frame proved useful for exploring how gene expression changed over time. By contrast, our “wide” data frame is more convient for exploring how pairs of genes covary together. For example, we can generate bivariate scatter plots depicting the relationship between two genes in the four different experimental conditions: spellman.gene.focused %&gt;% filter(!is.na(YAL022C) &amp; !is.na(YAR018C)) %&gt;% # filter any missing values ggplot(aes(x = YAL022C, y = YAR018C)) + geom_point() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) + facet_wrap(~expt, nrow = 2, ncol = 2) 7.6.4 Calculating correlations between genes Let’s explore more global bivariate relationships by calculating all the pairwise correlations between genes, focusing our attention on only the top 1000 most variable genes (as calculated previously). Correlation is a measure of linear association between a pair of variables, and ranges from -1 to 1. A value near zero indicates the variables are uncorrelated (no linear association), while values approaching +1 indicate a strong positive association (the variables tend to get bigger or smaller together) while values near -1 indicate strong negative association (when one variable is larger, the other tends to be small). First, let’s reduce our “wide” data frame to including only the top 1000 genes: top.1k.wide &lt;- spellman.gene.focused %&gt;% # get expt and time column plus top 1000 genes select(expt, time, top.genes.1k) dim(top.1k.wide) [1] 73 1002 Now, we calculate the correlations between all those genes. We need to drop two columns from the data frame, corresponding to “expt” and “time”, and we then use the cor function to calculate the pairwise correlations. Since there is missing data (indicated with NAs) we also need to tell the cor function to only use pairwise complete observations when calculating correlations. spellman.cor &lt;- top.1k.wide %&gt;% select(-expt, -time) %&gt;% # drop expt and time cor(use = &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;) The correlation matrix is a square matrix with the number of rows and columns equal to the number of variables: dim(spellman.cor) [1] 1000 1000 To get the correlations with a gene of interest, we can index with the gene name on the rows of the correlation matrix. For example, to get all the correlations between the gene YAL022C and the other genes in the top 1000 set: spellman.cor[&quot;YAL022C&quot;,] YFR014C YFR053C YBL032W YDR274C YLR286C -0.0286883534

-0.0307749383 In the next statement we extract the names of the genes that have correlations with YAL022C greater than 0.6. First we test genes to see if they have a correlation with YAL022C greater than 0.6, which returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE values. This vector of Boolean values is than used to index into the rownames of the correlation matrix, pulling out the gene names where the statement was true. pos.corr.YAL022C &lt;- rownames(spellman.cor)[spellman.cor[&quot;YAL022C&quot;,] &gt; 0.6] length(pos.corr.YAL022C) [1] 15 We then return to our wide data to show this set of genes that are strongly positively correlated with YAL022C, using faceted line graphs: spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% pos.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = expt, group = gene)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.33) + facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;, nrow = 2, ncol = 2) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) We can similarly filter for genes that have negative correlations with YAL022C. neg.corr.YAL022C &lt;- colnames(spellman.cor)[spellman.cor[&quot;YAL022C&quot;,] &lt;= -0.4] As before we generate a faceted line plot showing these genes by experiment: spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% neg.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = expt, group = gene)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.33) + facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;, nrow = 2, ncol = 2) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) 7.6.5 Adding new columns and combining filtered data frames Now let’s create a new data frame by: 1) filtering on our list of genes that have strong positive and negative correlations with YAL022C; and 2) creating a new variable, “corr.with.YAL022C”, which indicates the sign of the correlation. We’ll use this new variable to group genes when we create the plot. pos.corr.df &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% pos.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% mutate(corr.with.YAL022C = &quot;positive&quot;) neg.corr.df &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% neg.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% mutate(corr.with.YAL022C = &quot;negative&quot;) combined.pos.neg &lt;- rbind(pos.corr.df, neg.corr.df) Finally, we plot the data, colored according to the correlation with YAL022C. ggplot(combined.pos.neg, aes(x = time, y = expression, group = gene, color = corr.with.YAL022C)) + geom_line(alpha=0.5) + facet_wrap(~ expt, nrow =2, ncol = 2, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) + # changes legend title for discrete color legends scale_color_discrete(name = &quot;Correlation with YAL022C&quot;) 7.7 Heat maps Line plots can become visually busy very quickly, and hence aren’t very useful for more than a few tens of genes. An alternative is a “heat map” which depicts data in a grid or table like form, with values indicated by color. Heat maps are good for depicting large amounts of data and providing a coarse “10,000 foot view”. We’ll be looking at lots of heat maps when we get into clustering, but here’s a simple example based on the genes that were positively and negatively correlated with YAL022C. 7.7.1 RColorBrewer The RColorBrewer packages provides nice color schemes that are useful for creating heat maps. RColorBrewer defines a set of color palettes that have been optimized for color discrimination, to be color blind friendly, etc. Once you’ve installed the RColorBrewer package you can see the available color palettes as so: library(RColorBrewer) # show representations of the palettes par(cex = 0.5) # reduce size of text in the follow plot display.brewer.all() 7.7.2 Creating a heat map using geom_tile We’ll use the geom_tile geom to create the heat map. We’ll depict genes in rows, time points in columns, and expression values by the fill color of each tile. We’ll use the Red-to-Blue (“RdBu”) color scheme defined in RColorBrewer, however we’ll reverse the scheme so blues represent low expression and reds represent high expression. # generate the color scheme to use color.scheme &lt;- rev(brewer.pal(8,&quot;RdBu&quot;)) # re-factor gene names so positive and negative genes are spatially distinct in plot combined.pos.neg$gene &lt;- factor(combined.pos.neg$gene, levels = c(pos.corr.YAL022C, neg.corr.YAL022C)) combined.pos.neg %&gt;% filter(expt == &quot;cdc28&quot;) %&gt;% # focus only on one condition ggplot(aes(x = time, y = gene)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = expression)) + scale_fill_gradientn(colors=color.scheme) + xlab(&quot;Time (mins)&quot;) Can you visually see the breakpoint between the positively and negatively correlated sets of genes? 7.7.3 A “fancy” figure If we want to get really fancy, we can use cowplot’s draw_plot function that allows us to place plots at arbitrary locations and at arbitrary sizes onto the canvas. The coordinates of the canvas run from 0 to 1, and the point (0, 0) is in the lower left corner of the canvas. We’ll use draw_plot to draw a complex figure with a heatmap on the left, and two smaller line plots on the right. cdc28.filtered &lt;- filter(combined.pos.neg, expt == &quot;cdc28&quot;) pos.corr.lineplot &lt;- cdc28.filtered %&gt;% filter(gene %in% pos.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, group = gene)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.33, color = &#39;red&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Expression&quot;, title = &quot;Genes Positively correlated\\nwith YAL022C&quot;) neg.corr.lineplot &lt;- cdc28.filtered %&gt;% filter(gene %in% neg.corr.YAL022C) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, group = gene)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.33, color = &#39;blue&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Expression&quot;, title = &quot;Genes negatively correlated\\nwith YAL022C&quot;) heat.map &lt;- ggplot(cdc28.filtered, aes(x = time, y = gene)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = expression)) + scale_fill_gradientn(colors=color.scheme) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Gene&quot;) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) fancy.plot &lt;- ggdraw() + draw_plot(heat.map, 0, 0, width = 0.6) + draw_plot(neg.corr.lineplot, 0.6, 0.5, width = 0.4, height = 0.5) + draw_plot(pos.corr.lineplot, 0.6, 0, width = 0.4, height = 0.5) + draw_plot_label(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), c(0, 0.6, 0.6), c(1, 1, 0.5), size = 15) fancy.plot 7.7.4 Sorting and visualizing genes by time of maximum expression In a time series data one might be interested in examing genes with respect to some property of their dynamic expression. Here we’ll focus on the 1000 most variable genes, sort the data from the alpha factor synchronization experiment by time of maximum expression. First let’s filter our tidy, long data frame to include only our top 1000 genes and the alpha factor measurements: top1k.alpha.long &lt;- spellman.final %&gt;% filter(gene %in% top.genes.1k, expt == &quot;alpha&quot;) To find the time of maximum expression we’ll employ the function which.max (which.min), which finds the index of the maximum (minimum) element of a vector. For example to find the index of the maximum expression measurement for YAL022C we could do: top1k.alpha.long %&gt;% filter(gene == &quot;YAL022C&quot;) %$% # note the exposition pipe operator! which.max(expression) [1] 18 From the code above we find that the index of the observation at which YAL022C is maximal is 18. To get the corresponding time point we can do something like this: top1k.alpha.long %&gt;% filter(gene == &quot;YAL022C&quot;) %$% # again note the exposition pipe operator! time[which.max(expression)] [1] 119 Thus YAL022C expression peaks at 119 minutes in the alpha factor experiment. To find the index of maximal expression of all genes we can apply the dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarize() functions peak.expression &lt;- top1k.alpha.long %&gt;% group_by(gene) %&gt;% summarise(peak = which.max(expression)) dim(peak.expression) [1] 1000 2 head(peak.expression, n = 10) # A tibble: 10 x 2 gene peak &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 YAL003W 10 2 YAL004W 8 3 YAL005C 16 4 YAL018C 1 5 YAL022C 18 6 YAL025C 8 7 YAL028W 16 8 YAL035W 16 9 YAL038W 18 10 YAL044C 17 We can then generate a heatmap where we sort the rows (genes) of the heatmap by their time of peak expression. We introduce a new geom – geom_raster – which is like geom_tile but better suited for large data. The explicit sorting of the data by peak expression is carried out in the call to scale_y_discrete where the limits (and order) of this axis are set with the limits argument (see scale_y_discrete and discrete_scale in the ggplot2 docs). top1k.alpha.long %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = gene)) + geom_raster(aes(fill = expression)) + # scale_fill_gradientn(limits=c(-2,2),colors=color.scheme) + scale_y_discrete(limits=peak.expression$gene[rev(order(peak.expression$peak))]) + labs(x = &quot;Time (mins)&quot;, y = &quot;Genes&quot;, title = &quot;1000 most variable genes&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Sorted by time of peak expression&quot;) + # the following line suppresses tick and labels on y-axi theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) Figure 7.1: A Heatmap showing genes in the alpha-factor experiment, sorted by peak expression "],

This operator also designates matrix multiplication, which we will discuss next week. By default this operator returns an object of the R matrix class. If you want a scalar (or the R equivalent of a scalar, i.e. a vector of length 1) you need to use the drop() function. &gt; z &lt;- x %*% x &gt; class(z) # note use of class() function [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &gt; z [,1] [1,] 1240 &gt; drop(z) [1] 1240 In lecture we saw that many useful geometric properties of vectors could be expressed in the form of dot products. Let’s start with some two-dimensional vectors where the geometry is easy to visualize: &gt; a &lt;- c(2, 0) # the point (2,0) &gt; b &lt;- c(1, 3) # the point (1,3) To draw our vectors using ggplot, we’ll need to create a data frame with columns representing the x,y coordinates of the end-points of our vectors: df &lt;- data.frame(x.end = c(a[1], b[1]), y.end = c(a[2], b[2]), label = c(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;)) ggplot(df) + geom_segment(aes(x=0, y = 0, xend = x.end, yend = y.end, color=label), arrow = arrow()) + labs(x = &quot;x-coordinate&quot;, y = &quot;y-coordinate&quot;) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + # insures x and y axis scale are same theme_bw() Let’s see what the dot product can tell us about these vectors. First recall that we can calculate the length of a vector as the square-root of the dot product of the vector with itself (\\(\\vert\\vec{a}\\vert^2 = \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{a}\\)) &gt; len.a &lt;- drop(sqrt(a %*% a)) &gt; len.a [1] 2 &gt; len.b &lt;- drop(sqrt(b %*% b)) &gt; len.b [1] 3.162278 How about the angle between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? First we can use the dot product and the previously calculated lengths to calculate the cosine of the angle between the vectors: &gt; cos.ab &lt;- (a %*% b)/(len.a * len.b) &gt; cos.ab [,1] [1,] 0.3162278 To go from the cosine of the angle to the angle (in radians) we need the arc-cosine function, acos(): &gt; acos(cos.ab) # given angle in radians [,1] [1,] 1.249046 8.3 Writing Your Own Functions in R So far we’ve been using a variety of built in functions in R. However the real power of a programming language is the ability to write your own functions. Functions are a mechanism for organizing and abstracting a set of related computations. We usually write functions to represent sets of computations that we apply frequently, or to represent some conceptually coherent set of manipulations to data. The general form of an R function is as follows: funcname &lt;- function(arg1, arg2) { # one or more expressions that operate on the fxn arguments # last expression is the object returned # or you can explicitly return an object } To make this concrete, here’s an example where we define a function to calculate the geometric length of a vector using dot products: vec.length &lt;- function(x) { return(sqrt(drop(x %*% x))) } Since R returns the value of the last expression in the function, the return call is optional and we could have simply written: vec.length &lt;- function(x) { sqrt(drop(x %*% x)) } Very short and concise functions are often written as a single line. Here’s a single line version in which I also use pipes to unpack the nested function calls vec.length &lt;- function(x) {(x %*% x) %&gt;% drop %&gt;% sqrt } The vec.length function takes one argument, x, and calculates the length of the vector represented by x. Having defined the function we can immediately put it to use: vec.length(b) [1] 3.162278 If you type a function name without parentheses R shows you the function’s definition. This works for built-in functions as well (thought sometimes these functions are defined in C code in which case R will tell you that the function is a .Primitive). 8.4 Function arguments Function arguments can specify the data that a function operates on or parameters that the function uses. Function arguments can be either required or optional. In the case of optional arguments, a default value is assigned if the argument is not given. Take for example the log function. If you examine the help file for the log function (type ?log now) you’ll see that it takes two arguments, refered to as x and base. The argument x represents the numeric vector you pass to the function and is a required argument (see what happens when you type log() without giving an argument). The argument base is optional. By default the value of base is \\(e = 2.71828\\ldots\\). Therefore by default the log function returns natural logarithms. If you want logarithms to a different base you can change the base argument as in the following examples: &gt; log(2) # log of 2, base e [1] 0.6931472 &gt; log(2,2) # log of 2, base 2 [1] 1 &gt; log(2, 4) # log of 2, base 4 [1] 0.5 Because base 2 and base 10 logarithms are fairly commonly used, there are convenient aliases for calling log with these bases. &gt; log2(8) [1] 3 &gt; log10(100) [1] 2 8.5 Writing functions with optional arguments To write a function that has an optional argument, you can simply specify the optional argument and its default value in the function definition as so: # a function to substitute missing values in a vector sub.missing &lt;- function(x, sub.value = -99){ x[is.na(x)] &lt;- sub.value return(x) } You can then use this function as so: &gt; m &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4) &gt; sub.missing(m, -999) # explicitly define sub.value [1] 1 2 -999 4 &gt; sub.missing(m, sub.value = -333) # more explicit syntax [1] 1 2 -333 4 &gt; sub.missing(m) # use default sub.value [1] 1 2 -99 4 &gt; m # notice that m wasn&#39;t modified within the function [1] 1 2 NA 4 Notice that when we called sub.missing with our vector m, the vector did not get modified in the function body. Rather a new vector, x was created within the function and returned. However, if you did the missing value subsitute outside of a function call, then the vector would be modified: &gt; n &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4) &gt; n[is.na(n)] &lt;- -99 &gt; n [1] 1 2 -99 4 8.6 Putting R functions in Scripts When you define a function at the interactive prompt and then close the interpreter your function definition will be lost. If you put your functions in an R notebook, you have a record of your functions but you can’t use those function in another notebook without copying and pasting codeblock. The simple way around this is to define your R functions in a script that you can than access at any time. In RStudio choose File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. This will bring up a blank editor window. Type your function(s) into the editor. Everything in this file will be interpretted as R code, so you should not use the code block notation that is used in Markdown notebooks. Save the source file in your R working directory with a name like vecgeom.R. # functions defined in vecgeom.R vec.length &lt;- function(x) { # calculate the geometric length of a vecotr sqrt(drop(x %*% x)) } unit.vector &lt;- function(x) { # Return a unit vector in the same direction as x x/vec.length(x) } Notice that it is possible (and in fact typical) to use one function you define in writing another function (in this case we used vec.length() to write unit.vector()) Once your functions are in a script file you can make them accesible by using the source function, which reads the named file as input and evaluates any definitions or statements in the input file (See also the Source button in the R Studio GUI): source(&quot;vecgeom.R&quot;) Note that if you change the source file, such as correcting a mistake or adding a new function, you need to call the source function again to make those changes available. Having sourced the file you can now use your functions like so: &gt; x &lt;- c(1, 0.4) &gt; vec.length(x) [1] 1.077033 &gt; ux &lt;- unit.vector(x) &gt; ux [1] 0.9284767 0.3713907 &gt; a &lt;- 1:5 &gt; vec.length(a) [1] 7.416198 &gt; unit.vector(a) [1] 0.1348400 0.2696799 0.4045199 0.5393599 0.6741999 Note that our functions, vec.length() and unit.vector(), work with vectors of arbitrary dimension. 8.7 Simple statistics in vector form Now let’s turn our attention to seeing how to calculate a variety of simple statistics such as the mean, variance, etc. in terms of vector operations. To illustrate these oeprations we’ll use the I. setosa data from the iris examplar data set. setosa &lt;- filter(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) 8.7.1 Mean First let’s calculate the mean for the Sepal.Length variable. Referring back to the slides for today’s lecture, we see we can calculate the mean as: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\vec{1} \\cdot \\vec{x}}{\\vec{1} \\cdot \\vec{1}} \\] &gt; sepal.length &lt;- setosa$Sepal.Length &gt; ones &lt;- rep(1, length(sepal.length)) # 1-vector of length n &gt; mean.sepal.length &lt;- (ones %*% sepal.length)/(ones %*% ones) &gt; mean.sepal.length %&lt;&gt;% drop # use drop to convert back to scalar &gt; mean.sepal.length [1] 5.006 Let’s compare our calculation against the built-in mean function: &gt; mean(sepal.length) [1] 5.006 8.7.2 Variance and standard deviation Now let’s create a mean centered vector from sepal.length, which we’ll refer to as the vector of deviates about the mean: &gt; sepal.length.deviates &lt;- sepal.length - mean.sepal.length Using the vector of deviates we can easily calculate the variance and standard deviation of sepal.length: &gt; n &lt;- length(sepal.length.deviates) &gt; var.sepal.length &lt;- (sepal.length.deviates %*% sepal.length.deviates)/(n-1) &gt; var.sepal.length [,1] [1,] 0.124249 &gt; sd.sepal.length &lt;- sqrt(var.sepal.length) &gt; sd.sepal.length [,1] [1,] 0.3524897 Again, we can compare our calculations to the built-in var() and sd() functions: &gt; var(sepal.length) [1] 0.124249 &gt; sd(sepal.length) [1] 0.3524897 8.7.3 Covariance and correlation Now let’s consider the common measures of bivariate association, covariance and correlation. We’ll examine the relationship between sepal length and width: sepal.width &lt;- setosa$Sepal.Width mean.sepal.width &lt;- drop((ones %*% sepal.width)/(ones %*% ones)) sepal.width.deviates &lt;- sepal.width - mean.sepal.width var.sepal.width &lt;- drop((sepal.width.deviates %*% sepal.width.deviates)/(n-1)) sd.sepal.width &lt;- drop(sqrt(var.sepal.width)) With the vector of sepal width deviates in hand we can now calculate covariances: &gt; cov.swidth.slength &lt;- (sepal.length.deviates %*% sepal.width.deviates)/(n-1) &gt; cov.swidth.slength [,1] [1,] 0.09921633 &gt; cov(sepal.length, sepal.width) # and compare to built-in covariance [1] 0.09921633 And correlations: &gt; corr.swidth.slength &lt;- + (sepal.length.deviates %*% sepal.width.deviates) / (vec.length(sepal.length.deviates) * vec.length(sepal.width.deviates)) &gt; corr.swidth.slength [,1] [1,] 0.7425467 &gt; cor(sepal.length, sepal.width) # and compare to built-in correlation [1] 0.7425467 Alternately, we could have calculated the correlation more simply as follows: &gt; cov.swidth.slength/(sd.sepal.length * sd.sepal.width) [,1] [1,] 0.7425467 "],

Linear models are among the simplest statistical models. In a linear model relating two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the general form of the model can be stated as “I assume that \\(Y\\) can be expressed as a linear function of \\(X\\)”. The process of model fitting is then the task of finding the coefficients (parameters) of the linear model which best fit the observed data. Linear functions are those whose graphs are straight lines. A linear function of a variable \\(X\\) is usually written as: \\[ \\hat{Y} = f(X) = a + bX \\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants. In geometric terms \\(b\\) is the slope of the line and \\(a\\) is the value of the function when \\(X\\) is zero (usually the referred to as the “Y-intercept”). The slope tells you have much \\(Y\\) changes per unit change of \\(X\\). In vector terms, the above linear model can be written as: \\[ \\vec{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} = a\\vec{\\mathbf{1}} + b\\vec{\\mathbf{x}} \\] In order to fit a model to data, we have to specify some criterion for judging how well alternate models perform. In linear regression, the optimality criterion can be expressed as “Find the linear function, \\(f(X)\\), that minimizes the following quantity: \\[ \\sum (y_i - f(x_i))^2 \\] That is, our goal is to find the linear function of \\(X\\) that minimizes the squared deviations in the \\(Y\\) direction. With a little calculus and linear algebra one can show that the values of \\(b\\) (slope) and \\(a\\) (intercept) that minimize the sum of squared deviations described above are: \\[\\begin{align} b &amp;= \\frac{\\vec{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{y}}}{\\vec{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{x}}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{s_{xy}}{s^2_x} \\\\ &amp;= r_{xy}\\frac{s_y}{s_x}\\\\ \\\\ a &amp;= \\overline{Y} - b\\overline{X} \\end{align}\\] where \\(r_{xy}\\) is the correlation coefficient between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(s_x\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) respectively. 9.1 Regression terminology Predictors, explanatory, or independent variable – the variables from which we want to make our prediction. Outcomes, dependent, or response variable – the variable we are trying to predict in our regression. 9.2 Libraries library(tidyverse) 9.3 Illustrating linear regression with simulated data To illustrate how regression works, we’ll use a simulated data set where we specify the relationship between two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Using a simulation is desirable because it allows us to know what the “true” underlying model that relates \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is, so we can evaluate how well we do in terms of recovering the model. Let’s generate two vectors representing the variable, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), where \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(X\\) plus some independent noise. As specified below, the “true” model is \\(Y = 1.5X + 1.0 + \\epsilon_y\\) where \\(\\epsilon_y\\) is a noise term. # this seeds our random number generator # by setting a seed, we can make random number generation reproducible set.seed(20160921) npts &lt;- 50 X &lt;- seq(1, 5, length.out = npts) + rnorm(npts) a &lt;- 1.0 b &lt;- 1.5 Y &lt;- b*X + a + rnorm(npts, sd = 2) # Y = 1.5X + 1.0 + noise df.xy &lt;- data.frame(X = X, Y = Y) Having generated some simulated data, let’s visualize it. library(ggExtra) # a new library, provides ggMarginal plot # install if you don&#39;t already have it p &lt;- ggplot(df.xy, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point() ggMarginal(p, type = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 11) 9.4 Specifying Regression Models in R R, of course, has a built-in function for fitting linear regression models. The function lm() can be used not only to carry out bivariate linear regression but a wide range of linear models, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and others. fit.xy &lt;- lm(Y ~ X, df.xy) The first argument to lm is an R “formula”, the second argument is a data frame. Formulas are R’s way of specifying models, though they find other uses as well (e.g. we saw the formula syntax when we introduced the facet_wrap and facet_grid functions from ggplot). The general form of a formula in R is response variable ~ explanatory variables. In the code example above, we have only a single explanatory variable, and thus our response variable is Y and our explanatory variable is X. We’ll see more advanced R formulas in later lectures, but for now just remember that the variable to the left of the tilde is the one you’re trying to predict and the variable to the right is the explanatory variable. The lm function returns a list with a number of different components. The ones of most interest to us are fitted.values, coefficients, residuals, and (see the lm documentation for full details.) fit.xy Call: lm(formula = Y ~ X, data = df.xy) Coefficients: (Intercept) X 0.7688 1.5511 Calling summary on a fit model provides more detailed output: summary(fit.xy) Call: lm(formula = Y ~ X, data = df.xy) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.3723 -1.2391 -0.1677 1.4593 3.1808 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

We can plot these predicted values of \\(Y\\), as shown below: ggplot(df.xy, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + # observed data geom_point(aes(x = X, y = fit.xy$fitted.values), # predicted data color=&#39;red&#39;, alpha=0.5) 9.4.2 Getting the model coefficients The coefficients components gives the value of the model parameters, namely the intercept and slope. &gt; fit.xy$coefficients (Intercept) X 0.7687897 1.5510691 As shown above, the estimated slope is 1.5510691 and the estimated intercept is 0.7687897. Recall that because this is a synthetic example, we know the “true” underlying model, which is \\(Y = 1.5X + 1.0 + \\epsilon_x\\). On the face of it, it appears our regression model is doing a decent job of estimating the true model. With this information in hand we can draw the regression line as so: ggplot(df.xy, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + # observed data geom_abline(slope = fit.xy$coefficients[[2]], intercept = fit.xy$coefficients[[1]], color=&#39;red&#39;, alpha=0.5) Since linear model fitting is a fairly common task, the ggplot library includes a geometric mapping, geom_smooth, that will fit a linear model for us and generate the corresponding regression plot. ggplot(df.xy, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.75) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, color = &#39;red&#39;) By default, geom_smooth draws confidence intervals for the regression model (the shaded gray area around the regression line). 9.5 Residuals Residuals are the difference between the observed values of \\(Y\\) and the predicted values. You can think of residuals as the proportion of \\(Y\\) unaccounted for by the model. \\[ \\mbox{residuals} =\\vec{\\mathbf{e}} = \\vec{\\mathbf{y}} - \\vec{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} \\] We can draw the residuals from our model like so: ggplot(df.xy, aes(x = X)) + geom_point(aes(y = fit.xy$residuals)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = &#39;red&#39;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;X&quot;, y = &quot;Residuals&quot;) When the linear regression model is appropriate, residuals should be centered around zero and should show no strong trends or extreme differences in spread for different values of \\(X\\). 9.6 Regression as sum-of-squares decomposition Regression can be viewed as a decomposition of the sum-of-squared deviations. In vector terms this decomposition is: \\[ |\\vec{\\mathbf{y}}|^2 = |\\vec{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}|^2 + |\\vec{\\mathbf{e}}|^2 \\] More typically, this is written as: \\[ ss(Y) = ss(\\hat{Y}) + ss(\\mbox{residuals}) \\] Let’s check this for our example: &gt; ss.Y &lt;- sum((Y - mean(Y))^2) &gt; ss.Yhat &lt;- sum((fit.xy$fitted.values - mean(Y))^2) &gt; ss.residuals &lt;- sum(fit.xy$residuals^2) &gt; ss.Y [1] 412.6367 &gt; ss.Yhat + ss.residuals [1] 412.6367 9.7 Variance “explained” by a regression model We can use the sum-of-square decomposition to understand the relative proportion of variance “explained” (accounted for) by the regression model. We call this quantity the “Coefficient of Determination”, designated \\(R^2\\). \\[ R^2 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{SS_{residuals}}{SS_{total}} \\right) \\] For this particular example we can estimate \\(R^2\\) as follows: R2 &lt;- 1.0 - (ss.residuals/ss.Y) R2 [1] 0.6345462 In this particular example, we find our linear model accounts for about 63% of the variance in \\(Y\\). Note that the coefficient of determination is also reported when you apply the summary function to a linear model. 9.8 Broom: a library for converting model results into data frames The model fit object we got back when we used the lm function to carry out linear regression, carries lots of useful information it isn’t a particularly “tidy” way to access the data. The R package Broom converts “statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames, so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise processed with tools like ‘dplyr’, ‘tidyr’ and ‘ggplot2’. The discussion of Broom below is drawn from the Introduction to Broom Install the broom package before proceeding. library(broom) There are three broom functions that are particularly useful for our purposes. They are: tidy – constructs a data frame that summarizes the model’s statistical findings. augment – add columns to the original data that was modeled. This includes predictions, residuals, and cluster assignments. glance – construct a concise one-row summary of the model. 9.8.1 broom::tidy tidy applied to a regression model object returns a table giving the estimated coefficients and other information about the uncertainty of those estimates and corresponding p-values. For now we’re just interested in the estiamtes, the other values will be described in detail when we get to statistical inference. tidy(fit.xy) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 0.7687897 0.5754650 1.335945 1.878668e-01 2 X 1.5510691 0.1699007 9.129269 4.580723e-12 9.8.2 broom::augment augment creates a data frame that combines the original data with related information from the model fit. df.xy.augmented &lt;- augment(fit.xy, df.xy) head(df.xy.augmented) X Y .fitted .se.fit .resid .hat .sigma 1 2.0862011 3.025964557 4.004632 0.2993053 -0.9786672 0.02851475 1.785365 2 1.1202086 1.809581474 2.506311 0.4125607 -0.6967292 0.05417720 1.788179 3 1.8077907 4.985202523 3.572798 0.3275579 1.4124045 0.03415207 1.778921 4 1.3753651 3.227592763 2.902076 0.3790450 0.3255168 0.04573224 1.790570 5 1.0030005 -0.009990412 2.324513 0.4285481 -2.3345032 0.05845748 1.756516 6 0.8915551 -0.944425977 2.151653 0.4440440 -3.0960792 0.06276144 1.729420 .cooksd .std.resid 1 0.0046055129 -0.5601926 2 0.0046788147 -0.4041844 3 0.0116232759 0.8108213 4 0.0008469145 0.1880004 5 0.0571952511 -1.3573596 6 0.1090002740 -1.8042944 Now, in addition to the X and Y variables of the original data, we have columns like .fitted (value of Y predicted by the model for the corresponding value of X), .resid (difference between the actual Y and the predicted value), and a variety of other information for evalulating model uncertainty. One thing we can do with this “augmented” data frame is to use it to better visualize and explore the model. For example, if we wanted to generate a figure highlighting the deviations from the model using vertical lines emanating from the regression line, we could do something like this: ggplot(df.xy.augmented, aes(X, Y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, color=&quot;red&quot;,se=FALSE) + geom_segment(aes(xend = X, yend = .fitted), linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;) An another example, we can recreate our residual plot using the augmented data frame as so: ggplot(df.xy.augmented, aes(X, .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = &quot;red&quot;, linetype=&#39;dashed&#39;) + labs(y = &quot;Residuals&quot;, title = &quot;Residual plot for synthetic data example.&quot;) 9.8.3 broom::glance glance() provides summary information about the goodness of fit of the model. Most relevant for our current discussion is the column giving the coefficient of determination (r.squared): glance(fit.xy) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.6345462 0.6269326 1.772473 83.34355 4.580723e-12 2 -98.54516 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 203.0903 208.8264 150.7997 48 9.9 Bivariate linear regression on a real world data set Having walked through a simulation example, let’s now turn to a real world data set. A study by Whitman et al. (2004) showed that the amount of black coloring on the nose of male lions increases with age, and suggested that this might be used to estimate the age of unknown lions. To establish the relationship between these variables they measured the black coloring on the noses of male lions of known age (represented as a proportion), giving the bivariate relationship (and fitted model) shown below: lions &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://github.com/bio304-class/bio304-fall2017/raw/master/datasets/ABD-lion-noses.csv&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( proportionBlack = col_double(), ageInYears = col_double() ) ggplot(lions, aes(x = proportionBlack, y = ageInYears)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, color = &#39;red&#39;) By eye, the linear model looks like a pretty good fit. Let’s take a look at the quantitative values of the regression model, using the various Broom functions to produce nice output. lion.model &lt;- lm(ageInYears ~ proportionBlack, data = lions) tidy(lion.model) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 0.8790062 0.5688171 1.545323 1.327530e-01 2 proportionBlack 10.6471194 1.5095005 7.053406 7.677005e-08 glance(lion.model) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.623827 0.6112879 1.668764 49.75053 7.677005e-08 2 -60.76008 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 127.5202 131.9174 83.54321 30 We then augment our data set with information from the model fit and plots a residual plot. lions.augmented &lt;- augment(lion.model, lions) ggplot(lions.augmented, aes(proportionBlack, .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color=&quot;red&quot;, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;) "],

This is different than a data frame in which the columns of the frame can hold elements of different type (but all of the same length), or from a list which can hold objects of arbitrary type and length. Matrices are more efficient for carrying out most numerical operations, so if you’re working with a very large data set that is amenable to representation by a matrix you should consider using this data structure. library(tidyverse) 10.1 Creating matrices in R There are a number of different ways to create matrices in R. For creating small matrices at the command line you can use the matrix() function. &gt; x &lt;- matrix(1:5) # creates a column vector &gt; x [,1] [1,] 1 [2,] 2 [3,] 3 [4,] 4 [5,] 5 &gt; X &lt;- matrix(1:12, nrow=4) # creates a matr &gt; X [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 5 9 [2,] 2 6 10 [3,] 3 7 11 [4,] 4 8 12 &gt; dim(X) # give the shape of the matrix [1] 4 3 matrix() takes a data vector as input and the shape of the matrix to be created is specified by using the nrow and ncol arguments. If the number of elements in the input data vector is less than nrows \\(\\times\\) ncols the elements will be ‘recycled’ as discussed in previous chapters. Without any shape arguments the matrix() function will create a column vector as shown above. By default the matrix() function fills in the matrix in a column-wise fashion. To fill in the matrix in a row-wise fashion use the argument byrow=T. If you have a pre-existing data set in a list or data frame you can use the as.matrix() function to convert it to a matrix. &gt; iris.mtx &lt;- as.matrix(iris) &gt; head(iris.mtx) # NOTE: the elements were all converted to character Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species [1,] &quot;5.1&quot; &quot;3.5&quot; &quot;1.4&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; [2,] &quot;4.9&quot; &quot;3.0&quot; &quot;1.4&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; [3,] &quot;4.7&quot; &quot;3.2&quot; &quot;1.3&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; [4,] &quot;4.6&quot; &quot;3.1&quot; &quot;1.5&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; [5,] &quot;5.0&quot; &quot;3.6&quot; &quot;1.4&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; [6,] &quot;5.4&quot; &quot;3.9&quot; &quot;1.7&quot; &quot;0.4&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; Since all elements of an R matrix must be of the same type, when we passed the iris data frame to as.matrix(), everything was converted to a character due to the presence of the Species column in the data frame. &gt; # This is probably more along the lines of what you want &gt; iris.mtx &lt;- iris %&gt;% select(-Species) %&gt;% as.matrix &gt; head(iris.mtx) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width [1,] 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 [2,] 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 [3,] 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 [4,] 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 [5,] 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 [6,] 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 You can use the various indexing operations to get particular rows, columns, or elements. Here are some examples: &gt; X &lt;- matrix(1:12, nrow=4) &gt; X [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 5 9 [2,] 2 6 10 [3,] 3 7 11 [4,] 4 8 12 &gt; X[1,] # get the first row [1] 1 5 9 &gt; X[,1] # get the first column [1] 1 2 3 4 &gt; X[1:2,] # get the first two rows [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 5 9 [2,] 2 6 10 &gt; X[,2:3] # get the second and third columns [,1] [,2] [1,] 5 9 [2,] 6 10 [3,] 7 11 [4,] 8 12 &gt; Y &lt;- matrix(1:12, byrow=T, nrow=4) &gt; Y [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 2 3 [2,] 4 5 6 [3,] 7 8 9 [4,] 10 11 12 &gt; Y[4] # see explanation below [1] 10 &gt; Y[5] [1] 2 &gt; dim(Y) &lt;- c(2,6) # reshape Y &gt; Y [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [1,] 1 7 2 8 3 9 [2,] 4 10 5 11 6 12 &gt; Y[5] [1] 2 The example above where we create a matrix Y is meant to show that matrices are stored internally in a column wise fashion (think of the columns stacked one atop the other), regardless of whether we use the byrow=T argument. Therefore using single indices returns the elements with respect to this arrangement. Note also the use of assignment operator in conjuction with the dim() function to reshape the matrix. Despite the reshaping, the internal representation in memory hasn’t changed so Y[5] still gives the same element. You can use the diag() function to get the diagonal of a matrix or to create a diagonal matrix as show below: &gt; Z &lt;- matrix(rnorm(16), ncol=4) &gt; Z [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 0.2813681 -1.4982809 0.9894849 1.4907441 [2,] -0.2200975 -0.6530464 -1.5459291 -0.3988433 [3,] 0.9326019 -0.5406263 0.8606377 -1.3769548 [4,] -2.0768741 -0.8227990 1.0986354 0.6869724 &gt; diag(Z) [1] 0.2813681 -0.6530464 0.8606377 0.6869724 &gt; diag(5) # create the 5 x 5 identity matrix [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 &gt; s &lt;- sqrt(10:13) &gt; diag(s) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 3.162278 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 [2,] 0.000000 3.316625 0.000000 0.000000 [3,] 0.000000 0.000000 3.464102 0.000000 [4,] 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 3.605551 10.2 Matrix arithmetic operations in R The standard mathematical operations of addition and subtraction and scalar multiplication work element-wise for matrices in the same way as they did for vectors.

Below I give formulae for calculating some descriptive statistics as matrix functions. 10.3.1 Mean vector and matrix You can calculate a row vector of means, \\(\\mathbf{m}\\), as: \\[ \\mathbf{m} = \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{1}^T X \\] where \\(1\\) is a \\(n \\times 1\\) vector of ones. A \\(n \\times p\\) matrix \\(M\\) where each column is filled with the mean value for that column is: \\[ M = \\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{m} \\] 10.3.2 Deviation matrix To re-express each value as the deviation from the variable means (i.e.~each columns is a mean centered vector) we calculate a deviation matrix: \\[ D = X - M \\] 10.3.3 Covariance matrix The \\(p \\times p\\) covariance matrix can be expressed as a matrix product of the deviation matrix: \\[ S = \\frac{1}{n-1} D^T D \\] 10.3.4 Correlation matrix The correlation matrix, \\(R\\), can be calculated from the covariance matrix by: \\[ R = V S V \\] where \\(V\\) is a \\(p \\times p\\) diagonal matrix where \\(V_{ii} = 1/\\sqrt{S_{ii}}\\). 10.4 Matrix Inverse The function solve() can be used to find matrix inverses in R.

Install the following packages via one of the standard install mechanisms: scatterplot3d rgl – NOTE: On OS X, rgl requires you to install a program called XQuartz. XQuartz can be downloaded from the XQuartz Home Page. If you’re on a Mac, install XQuartz before installing rgl. You may have to reboot your computer after installing XQuartz. 11.2 Libraries library(tidyverse) library(broom) # for working w/lm output 11.3 Examplar data To illustrate multiple regression in R we’ll use a built in dataset called trees. trees consists of measurements of the girth, height, and volume of 31 black cherry trees (?trees for more info). Let’s assume we’re lumberjacks, but our permit only allows us to harvest a fixed number of trees. We get paid by the total volume of wood we harvest, so we’re interested in predicting a tree’s volume (hard to measure directly) as a function of its girth and height (relatively easy to measure), so we can pick the best trees to harvest. We’ll therefore calculate a multiple regression of volume on height and width. 11.4 Data exploration We’ll start with some summary tables and diagnostic plots to familiarize ourselves with the data: names(trees) [1] &quot;Girth&quot; &quot;Height&quot; &quot;Volume&quot; dim(trees) [1] 31 3 summary(trees) Girth Height Volume Min. : 8.30 Min. :63 Min. :10.20 1st Qu.:11.05 1st Qu.:72 1st Qu.:19.40 Median :12.90 Median :76 Median :24.20 Mean :13.25 Mean :76 Mean :30.17 3rd Qu.:15.25 3rd Qu.:80 3rd Qu.:37.30 Max. :20.60 Max. :87 Max. :77.00 We’ll use the GGally::ggpairs() function introduced in problem set 01 to create a scatterplot matrix depicting the pairwise relationships between all the variables library(GGally) ggpairs(trees) As one might expect for morphological measurements related to size, the scatterplot matrix shows that all the variables are positively correlated, and girth and volume have a particularly strong correlation. 11.5 3D Plots ggplot has no built in facilities for 3D scatter plots so we’ll use two new packages, scatterplot3D and rgl, to generate 3D visualizations. 11.5.1 scatterplot3d library(scatterplot3d) # install this package first if needed scatterplot3d(trees, main = &#39;Tree Volume as\\na function of Girth and Height&#39;) The argument pch sets the type of plotting character to use in the plot (for a graphical key of the available plotting characters see this link) and color sets plotting character colors. We can change the angle of the 3D plot using the angle argument: scatterplot3d(trees, pch = 16, color=&quot;steelblue&quot;, angle=75, main = &#39;Tree Volume as\\na function of Girth and Height&#39;) We can add vertical lines to the plot using the type argument and remove the box around the plot: scatterplot3d(trees, pch = 16, color=&quot;steelblue&quot;, angle=75, box = FALSE, type = &quot;h&quot;, main = &#39;Tree Volume as\\na function of Girth and Height&#39;) For more examples of how you can modify plots generated with the scatterplot3d package see this web page). 11.5.2 rgl The package rgl is another package that we can use for 3D visualization. rgl is powerful because it lets us create interactive plots we can rotate and zoom in/out on. To make rgl plots work in HTML document, make your codeblock start with this header: {r, results = &quot;asis&quot;} You can then create an interactive 3D plot as so: library(rgl) # create 3D scatter, using spheres to draw points plot3d(trees$Girth, trees$Height, trees$Volume, xlab = &quot;Girth&quot;, ylab = &quot;Height&quot;, zlab = &quot;Volume&quot;, type = &quot;s&quot;, size = 1.5, col = &quot;red&quot;) rglwidget() # only need to include this line if using in a markdown document 11.6 Fitting the regression model From the 3D scatter plot it looks like we ought to be able to find a plane through the data that fits the scatter fairly well. Let’s use the lm() function to calculate the multiple regression and summary() to get the details of the model: fit.trees &lt;- lm(Volume ~ Girth + Height, data=trees) summary(fit.trees) Call: lm(formula = Volume ~ Girth + Height, data = trees) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.4065 -2.6493 -0.2876 2.2003 8.4847 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Since they’re on different scales the coefficients for Girth and Height aren’t directly comparable. Both coefficients are significant at the \\(p&lt;0.05\\) level, but note that Girth is the much stronger predictor. In fact the addition of height explains only a minor additional fraction of variation in tree volume, so from the lumberjack’s perspective the additional trouble of measuring height probably isn’t worth it. 11.8 Exploring the Vector Geometry of the Regression Model The object returned by the lm() function hold lots of useful information: names(fit.trees) [1] &quot;coefficients&quot; &quot;residuals&quot; &quot;effects&quot; &quot;rank&quot; [5] &quot;fitted.values&quot; &quot;assign&quot; &quot;qr&quot; &quot;df.residual&quot; [9] &quot;xlevels&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;terms&quot; &quot;model&quot; The fitted.values correspond to the predicted values of the outcome variable (\\(\\hat{y}\\)). Alternate we can get this information in useful table form using functions from the broom library: Recall the broom:tidy produces a tabular summary of the coefficients of the model and their associated statistics: broom::tidy(fit.trees) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) -57.9876589 8.6382259 -6.712913 2.749507e-07 2 Girth 4.7081605 0.2642646 17.816084 8.223304e-17 3 Height 0.3392512 0.1301512 2.606594 1.449097e-02 broom:glance provides information about the fit of the model: broom::glance(fit.trees) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.94795 0.9442322 3.881832 254.9723 1.071238e-18 3 -84.45499 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 176.91 182.6459 421.9214 28 Let’s use our knowledge of vector geometry to further explore the relationship between the predicted Volume and the predictor variables. By definition the vector representing the predicted values lies in the subspace (in this case a plane) defined by Height and Girth, so let’s do some simple calculations to understand their length and angular relationships: # proportional to length of vectors sd(fit.trees$fitted.values) [1] 16.00434 sd(trees$Height) [1] 6.371813 sd(trees$Girth) [1] 3.138139 # cosines of angles btw vectors cor(trees$Height, trees$Girth) [1] 0.5192801 cor(trees$Girth, fit.trees$fitted.values) [1] 0.9933158 cor(trees$Height, fit.trees$fitted.values) [1] 0.6144545 # angles btw vectors in degrees acos(cor(trees$Girth, trees$Height)) * (180/pi) [1] 58.71603 acos(cor(trees$Girth, fit.trees$fitted.values)) * (180/pi) [1] 6.628322 acos(cor(trees$Height, fit.trees$fitted.values)) * (180/pi) [1] 52.08771 11.9 Exploring the Residuals from the Model Fit Now let’s look at the residuals from the regression. The residuals represent the `unexplained’ variance: trees.augmented &lt;- augment(fit.trees, trees) ggplot(trees.augmented, aes(x = Girth, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color=&#39;red&#39;, linetype=&#39;dashed&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Girth&quot;, y = &quot;Residuals&quot;) Ideally the residuals should be evenly scattered around zero, with no trends as we go from high to low values of the dependent variable. As you can see, the residuals are somewhat u-shaped or j-shaped suggesting that there may be a non-linear aspect of the relationship that our model isn’t capturing. 11.10 An alternate model Let’s think about the relationships we’re actually modeling for a few minutes. For the sake of simplicity let’s consider the trunk of a tree to be a cylinder. How do the dimensions of this cylinder relate to its volume? You can look up the formula for the volume of a cylinder, but the key thing you’ll want to note is that volume of the cylinder should be proportional to a characteristic length of the cylinder cubed (\\(V \\propto \\mathrm{L}^3\\)). This suggests that if we want to fit a linear model we should relate Girth and Height to \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\mathrm{Volume}}\\): trees.cuberoot &lt;- mutate(trees, cuberoot.Volume = Volume^0.33) fit.trees.cuberoot &lt;- lm(cuberoot.Volume ~ Girth + Height, data = trees.cuberoot) broom::glance(fit.trees) # summary of fit of original model r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.94795 0.9442322 3.881832 254.9723 1.071238e-18 3 -84.45499 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 176.91 182.6459 421.9214 28 broom::glance(fit.trees.cuberoot) # summary of fit of alternate model r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.9776484 0.9760518 0.08108365 612.3532 7.768237e-24 3 35.47103 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 -62.94206 -57.20611 0.1840877 28 Comparing the summary tables, we see indeed that using the cube root of Volume improves the fit of our model some. Let’s examine the residuals of this alternate model. trees.cuberoot &lt;- broom::augment(fit.trees.cuberoot, trees.cuberoot) ggplot(trees.cuberoot, aes(x = cuberoot.Volume, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color=&#39;red&#39;, linetype=&#39;dashed&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Girth&quot;, y = &quot;Residuals&quot;) As we can see the transformation we applied to the data did seem to make our residuals more uniform across the range of observations. 11.11 Fitting a curvilinear model using lm() Above we transformed the volume data in order to fit a straight line relationship between \\(\\sqrt[3]{V}\\) and Girth and Hieght. However, we could just as easily have applied a cubic regression to the original variables (remember this is still linear in the coefficients). Since Height didn’t add much to additional information, we’ll simplify the model to consider only Girth. fit.curvilinear &lt;- lm(Volume ~ I(Girth^3), data=trees) broom::tidy(fit.curvilinear) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 8.042696007 1.0426698301 7.71356 1.662577e-08 2 I(Girth^3) 0.008136533 0.0003117691 26.09795 1.086600e-21 broom::glance(fit.curvilinear) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.9591608 0.9577526 3.378663 681.1029 1.0866e-21 2 -80.69526 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 167.3905 171.6925 331.0456 29 Here’s how we can visualize the corresponding curvilinear regression using ggplot: ggplot(trees, aes(x = Girth, y = Volume)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, formula = y ~ I(x^3), se = FALSE) The I() function used above requires a little explanation. Normally, the R formula syntax (see ?formula) treats the carat symbol, ^, as short-hand for factor crossing to the specified degree. For example, the formula (a+b+c)^2 would be interpretted as the model with main effects and all second order interaction terms, i.e. a + b + c + a:b + a:c + b:c where the colons indicate interactions. The I() function `protects’ the object in it’s argument; in this case telling the regression function to treat this as Girth raised to the third power as opposed to trying to construct interaction terms for Girth. 11.12 Exploring the impact of nearly collinear predictors on regression In lecture we discussed the problems that can arise in regression when your predictor variables are nearly collinear. In this section we’ll illustrate some of these issues. Consider again the trees data set. Recall that two of the variables – Girth and Volume – are highly correlated and thus nearly collinear. cor(trees) Girth Height Volume Girth 1.0000000 0.5192801 0.9671194 Height 0.5192801 1.0000000 0.5982497 Volume 0.9671194 0.5982497 1.0000000 Let’s explore what happens when we treat Height as the dependent variable, and Girth and Volume as the predictor variables. fit.Height &lt;- lm(Height ~ Girth + Volume, data = trees) broom::glance(fit.Height) r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik 1 0.4122678 0.3702869 5.056318 9.820371 0.0005868313 3 -92.64926 AIC BIC deviance df.residual 1 193.2985 199.0345 715.8579 28 We can, of course, fit the linear model despite the near collinearity, and we find that the model does have some predictive power, with \\(R^2 = 0.41\\), and with Volume being the more significant predictor. Now, let’s created a slightly different version of the trees data set by add some noise to the three variables. Our goal here is to simulate a data set we might have created had we measured a slightly different set of trees during our sampling. We’ll use the jitter() function to add uniform noise to the data set. jitter.Girth &lt;- jitter(trees$Girth, amount= 0.5 * sd(trees$Girth)) jitter.Height &lt;- jitter(trees$Height, amount= 0.5 * sd(trees$Height)) jitter.Volume &lt;- jitter(trees$Volume, amount= 0.5 * sd(trees$Volume)) jitter.trees &lt;- data.frame(Girth = jitter.Girth, Height = jitter.Height, Volume = jitter.Volume) Here we added uniform noise proportional to the one-quarter the standard deviation of each variable. Let’s take a moment to convince ourselves that our new data set, jitter.trees, is not too different from the trees data set from which it was derived. set.seed(20180228) # compare this to broom::tidy(trees) broom::tidy(jitter.trees) column n mean sd median trimmed mad min 1 Girth 31 13.12941 3.254615 12.68101 12.93121 3.141887 7.899714 2 Height 31 75.61539 6.833216 75.19582 75.73138 6.742719 61.893582 3 Volume 31 30.38463 17.022313 21.64749 28.56103 8.936935 10.057182 max range skew kurtosis se 1 21.93581 14.03610 0.65775952 -0.08395162 0.5845461 2 88.12591 26.23232 -0.08102373 -0.88115858 1.2272818 3 71.95424 61.89706 0.84178093 -0.64817524 3.0572977 # correlations among jittered variables are # similar to those of the original variables cor(jitter.trees) Girth Height Volume Girth 1.0000000 0.5020319 0.8609323 Height 0.5020319 1.0000000 0.4845783 Volume 0.8609323 0.4845783 1.0000000 ## jittered variables are highly correlatd with original variables cor(trees$Height, jitter.trees$Height) [1] 0.9618093 cor(trees$Girth, jitter.trees$Girth) [1] 0.9594642 cor(trees$Volume, jitter.trees$Volume) [1] 0.9518737 Now that we’ve convinced ourselves that our jittered data set is a decent approximation to our original data set, let’s re-calculate the linear regression, and compare the coefficients of the jittered model to the original model: fit.Height.jitter &lt;- lm(Height ~ Girth + Volume, data = jitter.trees) broom::tidy(fit.Height) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 83.2957705 9.0865753 9.166905 6.333488e-10 2 Girth -1.8615109 1.1566879 -1.609346 1.187591e-01 3 Volume 0.5755946 0.2208225 2.606594 1.449097e-02 broom::tidy(fit.Height.jitter) term estimate std.error statistic p.value 1 (Intercept) 64.11040674 5.8941259 10.8770000 1.457665e-11 2 Girth 0.68830907 0.6697467 1.0277155 3.128805e-01 3 Volume 0.08122189 0.1280535 0.6342806 5.310461e-01 We see that the coefficients of the linear model have changed substantially between the original data and the jittered data. Our model is unstable to relatively modest changes to the data! Let’s draw some plots to illustrate how different the models fit to the original and jittered data are: # draw 3d scatter plots with small points so as not to obscure regression planes p &lt;- scatterplot3d(x=trees$Girth, y=trees$Volume, z=trees$Height, angle=15, type=&#39;p&#39;, pch=&#39;.&#39;) # original model p$plane3d(fit.Height, col=&#39;orangered&#39;) # jittered model p$plane3d(fit.Height.jitter, col=&#39;blue&#39;) Let’s do the same comparison for the multiple regression of Volume on Height and Girth. In this case the predictor variables are nearly collinear. fit.Volume &lt;- lm(Volume ~ Girth + Height, data = trees) fit.Volume.jitter &lt;- lm(Volume ~ Girth + Height, data = jitter.trees) coefficients(fit.Volume) (Intercept) Girth Height -57.9876589 4.7081605 0.3392512 coefficients(fit.Volume.jitter) (Intercept) Girth Height -39.5087487 4.3190348 0.1743959 For this model, we see that the coefficients have changed only a small amount. The underlying data, jitter.trees, is the same in both cases, but now our model is stable because the predictor variables are only modestly correlated with each other. Let’s generate another plot to illustrate the similarity of the models fit to the original and jittered data when Girth and Height are used to predict Volume. p &lt;- scatterplot3d(x=trees$Girth, y=trees$Height, z=trees$Volume, angle=55, type=&#39;p&#39;, pch=&#39;.&#39;) p$plane3d(fit.Volume, col=&#39;orangered&#39;) p$plane3d(fit.Volume.jitter, col=&#39;blue&#39;) Finally, let’s do some vector calculations to quantify how the angular deviation between the fit data and the predictor variables changes between the original and jittered data set for the two different multiple regressions: # write a quickie fxn to express angle between vectors in degrees vec.angle &lt;- function(x,y) { acos(cor(x,y)) * (180/pi)} # vector angles for fit of Height ~ Girth + Volume (orig) vec.angle(fit.Height$fitted.values, trees$Girth) [1] 36.02644 vec.angle(fit.Height$fitted.values, trees$Volume) [1] 21.29297 # vector angles for fit of Height ~ Girth + Volume (jittered) vec.angle(fit.Height.jitter$fitted.values, jitter.trees$Girth) [1] 11.58668 vec.angle(fit.Height.jitter$fitted.values, jitter.trees$Volume) [1] 18.9919 Now the same comparison for the non-collinear model Volume ~ Girth + Height. # vector angles for fit of Volume ~ Girth + Height (orig) vec.angle(fit.Volume$fitted.values, trees$Girth) [1] 6.628322 vec.angle(fit.Volume$fitted.values, trees$Height) [1] 52.08771 # vector angles for fit of Volume ~ Girth + Height (jittered) vec.angle(fit.Volume.jitter$fitted.values, jitter.trees$Girth) [1] 4.022743 vec.angle(fit.Volume.jitter$fitted.values, jitter.trees$Height) [1] 55.84274 "],

First we look at reflection in the x-axis: A &lt;- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, -1), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2) Ax &lt;- A %*% t(sin.xy) Ax.df &lt;- as.data.frame(t(Ax)) %&gt;% rename(x = V1, y = V2) ggplot(Ax.df, aes(x = x, y= y)) + geom_point() Now shear: A &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1.5, 0, 1), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2) Ax &lt;- A %*% t(sin.xy) Ax.df &lt;- as.data.frame(t(Ax)) %&gt;% rename(x = V1, y = V2) ggplot(Ax.df, aes(x = x, y= y)) + geom_point() And finally rotation: A &lt;- matrix(c(cos(pi/2), -sin(pi/2), sin(pi/2), cos(pi/2)), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2) Ax &lt;- A %*% t(sin.xy) Ax.df &lt;- as.data.frame(t(Ax)) %&gt;% rename(x = V1, y = V2) ggplot(Ax.df, aes(x = x, y= y)) + geom_point() 12.3 Eigenanalysis in R As we discussed in lecture, the eigenvectors of a square matrix, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), point in the directions that are unchanged by the transformation specified by \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The following relationships relate \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) to it’s eigenvectors and eigenvalues: \\[\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{D} \\] \\[\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{V}^{-1}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is a matrix where the columns represent the eigenvectors, and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The eigen() function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.

The princomp() function uses the eigen() function to carry out the analysis on the covariance matrix or correlation matrix, while carries out an equivalent analysis, starting from a data matrix, using a technique called singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD routine has greater numerical accuracy, so the prcomp() function should generally be preferred. The princomp() function is useful when you don’t have access to the original data, but you do have a covariance or correlation matrix (a frequent situation when re-analyzing data from the literature). We’ll concentrate on using the prcomp() function. 12.4.1 Bioenv dataset To demonstrate PCA we’ll use a dataset called `bioenv.txt’ (see class wiki), obtained from a book called “Biplots in Practice” (M. Greenacre, 2010). Here is Greenacre’s description of the dataset: The context is in marine biology and the data consist of two sets of variables observed at the same locations on the sea-bed: the first is a set of biological variables, the counts of five groups of species, and the second is a set of four environmental variables. The data set, called “bioenv”, is shown in Exhibit 2.1. The species groups are abbreviated as “a” to “e”. The environmental variables are “pollution”, a composite index of pollution combining measurements of heavy metal concentrations and hydrocarbons; depth, the depth in metres of the sea-bed where the sample was taken; “temperature”, the temperature of the water at the sampling point; and “sediment”, a classification of the substrate of the sample into one of three sediment categories. We’ll start by reading the bioenv.txt data set from the Github repository: bioenv &lt;- read_tsv(&#39;https://github.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/raw/master/bioenv.txt&#39;) Parsed with column specification: cols( X1 = col_character(), a = col_integer(), b = col_integer(), c = col_integer(), d = col_integer(), e = col_integer(), Pollution = col_double(), Depth = col_integer(), Temperature = col_double(), Sediment = col_character() ) names(bioenv) [1] &quot;X1&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; [6] &quot;e&quot; &quot;Pollution&quot; &quot;Depth&quot; &quot;Temperature&quot; &quot;Sediment&quot; Notice that the first column got assigned the generic name X1. This is because there is a missing column header in the bioenv.txt file. This first column corresponds to the sampling sites. Before we move on let’s give this column a more meaningful name: bioenv &lt;- bioenv %&gt;% rename(Site = X1) names(bioenv) [1] &quot;Site&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; [6] &quot;e&quot; &quot;Pollution&quot; &quot;Depth&quot; &quot;Temperature&quot; &quot;Sediment&quot; The columns labeled a to e contain the counts of the five species at each site, while the remaining columns give additional information about the physical properties of each sampling site. For our purposes today we’ll confine our attention to the abundance data. abundance &lt;- bioenv %&gt;% select(Site, a, b, c, d, e) head(abundance) # A tibble: 6 x 6 Site a b c d e &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 s1 0 2 9 14 2 2 s2 26 4 13 11 0 3 s3 0 10 9 8 0 4 s4 0 0 15 3 0 5 s5 13 5 3 10 7 6 s6 31 21 13 16 5 The data is currently in a “wide” format. For the purposes of plotting it will be more convenient to generate a “long” version of the data using functions from the tidyr library (see the Data Wrangling chapter). long.abundance &lt;- abundance %&gt;% tidyr::gather(Species, Count, -Site) head(long.abundance) # A tibble: 6 x 3 Site Species Count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 s1 a 0 2 s2 a 26 3 s3 a 0 4 s4 a 0 5 s5 a 13 6 s6 a 31 ggplot(long.abundance, aes(x = Species, y = Count)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, title=&quot;Distribution of\\nSpecies Counts per Site&quot;) From the boxplot it looks like the counts for species `e’ are smaller on average, and less variable. The mean and variance functions confirm that. long.abundance %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarize(mean(Count), var(Count)) # A tibble: 5 x 3 Species `mean(Count)` `var(Count)` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 a 13.5 158. 2 b 8.73 83.4 3 c 8.40 73.6 4 d 10.9 44.4 5 e 2.97 15.7 A correlation matrix suggests weak to moderate associations between the variables: abundance.only &lt;- abundance %&gt;% select(-Site) # drop the Site column cor(abundance.only) a b c d e a 1.0000000 0.67339954 -0.23992888 0.358192050 0.273522301 b 0.6733995 1.00000000 -0.08041947 0.501834036 0.036914702 c -0.2399289 -0.08041947 1.00000000 0.081504483 -0.343540453 d 0.3581921 0.50183404 0.08150448 1.000000000 -0.004048517 e 0.2735223 0.03691470 -0.34354045 -0.004048517 1.000000000 However a scatterplot matrix generated by the GGally::ggapirs() function suggests that many of the relationships have a strong non-linear element. ggpairs(abundance.only) 12.4.2 PCA of the Bioenv dataset Linearity is not a requirement for PCA, as it’s simply a rigid rotation of the original data. So we’ll continue with our analysis after taking a moment to read the help on the prcomp() function that is used to carry-out PCA in R. abundance.pca &lt;- prcomp(abundance.only, center=TRUE, retx=TRUE) # center=TRUE mean centers the data # retx=TRUE returns the PC scores # if you want to do PCA on the correlation matrix set scale.=TRUE # -- notice the period after scale! summary(abundance.pca) Importance of components: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 Standard deviation 14.8653 8.8149 6.2193 5.03477 3.48231 Proportion of Variance 0.5895 0.2073 0.1032 0.06763 0.03235 Cumulative Proportion 0.5895 0.7968 0.9000 0.96765 1.00000 We see that approximately 59% of the variance in the data is capture by the first PC, and approximately 90% by the first three PCs. Let’s compare the values return by PCA to what we would get if we carried out eigenanalysis of the covariance matrix that corresponds to our data. First the list object return by prcomp(): abundance.pca Standard deviations (1, .., p=5): [1] 14.865306 8.814912 6.219250 5.034774 3.482308 Rotation (n x k) = (5 x 5): PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 a 0.81064462 0.07052882 -0.53108427 0.18442140 -0.14771336 b 0.51264394 -0.27799671 0.47711910 -0.63418946 0.17342177 c -0.16235135 -0.88665551 -0.40897655 -0.01149647 0.14173943 d 0.22207108 -0.31665237 0.56250980 0.72941223 -0.04422938 e 0.06616623 0.17696554 -0.08141111 0.17781482 0.96231977 And now the corresponding values returned by eigenanaysis of the covariance matrix generated from the abundance data: eig.abundance &lt;- eigen(cov(abundance.only)) eig.abundance$vectors # compare to rotation matrix of PCA [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 0.81064462 -0.07052882 0.53108427 0.18442140 -0.14771336 [2,] 0.51264394 0.27799671 -0.47711910 -0.63418946 0.17342177 [3,] -0.16235135 0.88665551 0.40897655 -0.01149647 0.14173943 [4,] 0.22207108 0.31665237 -0.56250980 0.72941223 -0.04422938 [5,] 0.06616623 -0.17696554 0.08141111 0.17781482 0.96231977 sqrt(eig.abundance$values) # compare to sdev of PCA [1] 14.865306 8.814912 6.219250 5.034774 3.482308 Notice that the rotation object returned by the prcomp() represents the scaled eigenvectors (scaled to have length 1). The standard deviations of the PCA are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. 12.4.3 Calculating Factor Loadings Let’s calculate the “factor loadings” associated with the PCs: V &lt;- abundance.pca$rotation # eigenvectors L &lt;- diag(abundance.pca$sdev) # diag mtx w/sqrts of eigenvalues on diag. abundance.loadings &lt;- V %*% L abundance.loadings [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] a 12.0504801 0.6217053 -3.3029460 0.92852016 -0.5143835 b 7.6206090 -2.4505164 2.9673232 -3.19300085 0.6039081 c -2.4134024 -7.8157898 -2.5435276 -0.05788214 0.4935804 d 3.3011545 -2.7912626 3.4983893 3.67242602 -0.1540203 e 0.9835813 1.5599356 -0.5063161 0.89525751 3.3510942 The magnitude of the factor loadings is what you want to focus on. For example, species a and b contribute most to the first PC, while species c has the largest influence on PC2. You can think of the factor loadings, as defined above, as the components (i.e lengths of the projected vectors) of the original variables with respect to the PC basis vectors. Since vector length is proportional to the standard deviation of the variables they represent, you can think of the loadings as giving the standard deviation of the original variables with respect the PC axes. This implies that the loadings squared sum to the total variance in the original data, as illustrated below. sum(abundance.loadings**2) [1] 374.8345 abundance.only %&gt;% purrr::map_dbl(var) %&gt;% sum [1] 374.8345 12.5 Drawing Figures to Represent PCA 12.5.1 PC Score Plots The simplest PCA figure is to depict the PC scores, i.e. the projection of the observations into the space defined by the PC axes. Let’s make a figure with three subplots, depicting PC1 vs PC2, PC1 vs PC3, and PC2 vs. PC3. pca.scores.df &lt;- as.data.frame(abundance.pca$x) coord.system &lt;- coord_fixed(ratio=1, xlim=c(-30,30),ylim=c(-30,30)) pc1v2 &lt;- pca.scores.df %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y= PC2)) + geom_point() + coord.system pc1v3 &lt;- pca.scores.df %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y= PC3)) + geom_point() + coord.system pc2v3 &lt;- pca.scores.df %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = PC2, y= PC3)) + geom_point() + coord.system cowplot::plot_grid(pc1v2, pc1v3, pc2v3, align=&quot;hv&quot;) When plotting PC scores, it is very important to keep the aspect ratio with a value of 1, so that the distance between points in the plot is an accurate representation of the distance in the PC space. Note too that I used the xlim and ylim arguments to keep the axis limits the same in all plots; comparable scaling of axes is important when comparing plots. Also note the use of the align=&quot;hv&quot; argument to plot_grid() to keep my plots the same size when combining them into a single figure. 12.5.2 Simultaneous Depiction of Observations and Variables in the PC Space Let’s return to our simple PC score plot. As we discussed above, the loadings are components of the original variables in the space of the PCs. This implies we can depict those loadings in the same PC basis that we use to depict the scores. First let’s create a data frame with the loadings from the first two PCs as well as a column representation the variable names: loadings.1and2 &lt;- data.frame(abundance.loadings[,1:2]) %&gt;% rename(PC1.loading = X1, PC2.loading = X2) %&gt;% mutate(variable = row.names(abundance.loadings)) loadings.1and2 PC1.loading PC2.loading variable 1 12.0504801 0.6217053 a 2 7.6206090 -2.4505164 b 3 -2.4134024 -7.8157898 c 4 3.3011545 -2.7912626 d 5 0.9835813 1.5599356 e With this data frame in hand, we can now draw a set of vector to represent the original variables projected into the subspace defined by PCs 1 and 2: pc1v2.biplot &lt;- pc1v2 + geom_segment(data=loadings.1and2, aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = PC1.loading, yend = PC2.loading), color=&#39;red&#39;, arrow = arrow(angle=15, length=unit(0.1,&quot;inches&quot;))) + geom_text(data=loadings.1and2, aes(x = PC1.loading, y = PC2.loading, label=variable), color=&#39;red&#39;, nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 1) pc1v2.biplot The figure above is called a “biplot”“, as it simultaneously depicts both the observations and variables in the same space. From this biplot we can immediately see that variable a is highly correlated with PC1, but only weakly associated with PC2. Conversely, variable c is strongly correlated with PC2 but only weakly so with PC1. We can also approximate the correlations among the variables themselves – for example b and d are fairly strongly correlated, but weakly correlated with c. Keep in mind however that with respect to the relationships among the variables, this visualization is a 2D projection of a 5D space so the geometry is approximate. The biplot is a generally useful tool for multivariate analyses and there are a number of different ways to define biplots. We’ll study biplots more formally in a few weeks after we’ve covered singular value decomposition. "],

Population here could refer to an actual population (e.g. all males over 20 in the United States; brushtail possums in the state of Victoria, Australia), an abstract population (e.g. corn plants grown from Monsanto “round up ready” seed; yeast cells with genotypes identical to the reference strain S288c), outcomes of a stochastic process we can observe and measure (e.g. meiotic recombination in flies; hadrons detected at the LHC during a particle collision experiment), etc. It is often impractical or impossible to measure all objects/individuals in a population of interest, so we take a sample from the population and make measurements on the variables of interest in that sample. We do so with the hope that the various statistics we calculate on the variables of interest in that sample will be useful estimates of those same statistics in the underlying population. However, we must always keep in mind that the statistics we calculate from our sample will almost never exactly match those of the underlying population. That is when we collect a sample, and measure a statistic (e.g. mean) on variable X in the sample, there is a degree of uncertainty about how well our estimate matches the true value of that statistic for X in the underlying population. Statistical inference is about quantifying the uncertainty associated with statistics and using that information to test hypotheses and evaluate models. Today we’re going to review a fundamental concept in statistical inference, the notion of a sampling distribution for a statistic of interest. A sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a given statistic for samples of a given size. Traditionally sampling distributions were derived analytically. In this class session we’ll see how to approximate sampling distributions for any a statistic using computer simulation. 13.1 Libraries library(tidyverse) library(magrittr) library(stringr) 13.2 Data set: Simulated male heights To illustrate the concept of sampling distributions, we’ll use a simulated data set to represent the underlying population we’re trying to estimate statistics for. This will allow us to compare the various statistics we calculate and their sampling distributions to their “true” values. Let’s simulate a population consisting of 25,000 individuals with a single trait of interest – height (measured in centimeters). We will simulate this data set based on information about the distribution of the heights of adult males in the US estimated in a study carried out from 2011-2014 by the US Department of Health and Human Services1. 13.2.1 Seeding the pseudo-random number generator When carrying out simulations, we employ random number generators (e.g. to choose random samples). Most computers can not generate true random numbers – instead they use algorithms that approximate the generation of random numbers (pseudo-random number generators). One important difference between a true random number generator and a pseudo-random number generator is that we can regenerate a series of pseudo-random numbers if we know the “seed” value that initialized the algorithm. We can specifically set this seed value, so that we can guarantee that two different people evaluating this notebook get the same results, even though we’re using (pseudo)random numbers in our simulation. # make our simulation repeatable by seeding RNG set.seed(20180321) 13.2.2 Generating the simulated population Having seeded our RNG, we then generate our simulated population using the rnorm() function. rnorm() draws random values from a normal distribution with the given parameters of mean and standard deviation. We didn’t have to use a normal distribution for our simulations, but many biological variables are approximately normally distributed, so this is a common assumption. # male mean height and sd in centimeters from USDHHS report mean.ht &lt;- 175.7 sd.ht &lt;- 15.19 height.data &lt;- data_frame(height = rnorm(25000, mean = mean.ht, sd = sd.ht)) 13.2.3 Properties of the simulated population Let’s take a moment to visualize the distribution of heights in our population of interest: ggplot(height.data, aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins=50, alpha=0.5) + geom_density() + labs(x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of Heights in the Population of Interest&quot;) When we generated this simulated population, I specified that the heights should be drawn from a normal distribution. As one would expect, the histogram and density plot look fairly close to the classic bell-shaped curve of a normal distribution. Let’s turn some key summary statistics of the population. The values of these summary statistics are those we’re trying to estimate from our sample(s). We’ll refer to these as the “true” values. true.values &lt;- height.data %&gt;% summarize(mean.height = mean(height), sd.height = sd(height)) true.values # A tibble: 1 x 2 mean.height sd.height &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 176. 15.2 In mathematical notation our population is normally distributed with a mean height of 175.7201895cm and standard deviation of 15.1963663cm. Note that these values are close to, but not exactly the parametes we passed to rnorm(). 13.3 Random sampling from the simulated population Let’s simulate the process of taking a single sample of 30 individuals from our population, using the dplyr::sample_n() function: sample.a &lt;- height.data %&gt;% sample_n(30) Now we’ll create a histogram of the height variable in our sample. For reference we’ll also plot the histogram for the true population in the background (but remember, in the typical case you don’t know what the true population looks like) sample.a %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(data=height.data, aes(x = height, y = ..density..), alpha=0.25, bins=50) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), fill = &#39;steelblue&#39;, alpha=0.75, bins=9) + geom_vline(xintercept = true.values$mean.height, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample.a$height), linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of heights in the underlying population (grey)\\nand a single sample of size 30 (blue)&quot;) The solid vertical line represent the true mean of the population, the dashed line represents the sample mean. Comparing the two distributions we see that while our sample of 30 observations is relatively small,its location (center) and spread that are roughly similar to those of the underlying population. Let’s create a table giving the estimates of the mean and standard deviation in our sample: sample.a %&gt;% summarize(sample.mean = mean(height), sample.sd = sd(height)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 sample.mean sample.sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 173. 13.2 Based on our sample, we estimate that the mean height of males in our population of interest is 173.4747577cm with a standard deviation of 13.1761523cm. 13.3.1 Another random sample Let’s step back and think about our experiment. We took a random sample of 30 indiviuals from the population. The very nature of a “random sample” means we could just as well have gotten a different collection of individuals in our sample. Let’s take a second random sample of 25 individuals and see what the data looks like this time: sample.b &lt;- height.data %&gt;% sample_n(30) ggplot(sample.b, aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(data=height.data, aes(x = height, y = ..density..), alpha=0.25, bins=50) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), fill = &#39;steelblue&#39;, alpha=0.75, bins=9) + geom_vline(xintercept = true.values$mean.height, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample.b$height), linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of heights in the underlying population (grey)\\nand a single sample of size 30 (blue)&quot;) sample.b %&gt;% summarize(sample.mean = mean(height), sample.sd = sd(height)) # A tibble: 1 x 2 sample.mean sample.sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 175. 14.8 This time we estimated the mean height to be 175.1897271 cm and the standard deviation to be 14.8025475 cm. 13.3.2 Simulating the generation of many random samples When we estimate population parameters, like the mean and standard deviation, based on a sample, our estimates will differ from the true population values by some amount. Any given random sample might provide better or worse estimates than another sample. We can’t know how good our estimates of statistics like the mean and standard deviation are from any specific sample, but we we can study the behavior of such estimates across many simulated samples and learn something about how well our estimates do on average, as well the spread of these estimates. 13.3.3 A function to estimate statistics of interest in a random sample First we’re going to write a function called rsample.stats that to carries out the following steps: Given a data frame x Take a random sample of size n For the variable specified by the character string, var.name, calculate the mean and standard deviation of that variable in the random sample Return a table giving the sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation, represented as a data frame rsample.stats &lt;- function(x, n, var.name) { sample_x &lt;- sample_n(x, n) data_frame(sample.size = n, sample.mean = mean(sample_x[[var.name]]), sample.sd = sd(sample_x[[var.name]])) } Let’s test rsample.stats: rsample.stats(height.data, 30, &quot;height&quot;) # A tibble: 1 x 3 sample.size sample.mean sample.sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 30. 174. 16.7 13.3.4 Generating statistics for many random samples Now we’ll see how to combine rsample.stats with two additional functions to repeatedly run the rsample.stats function: df.samples.of.30 &lt;- rerun(1000, rsample.stats(height.data, 30, &quot;height&quot;)) %&gt;% bind_rows() The function rerun is defined in the purrr library (automatically loaded with tidyverse). purrr:rerun() re-runs an expression(s) multiple times. The first argument to rerun() is the number of times you want to re-run, and the following arguments are the expressions to be re-run. Thus the second line of the code block above re-runs the rsample.stats function 1000 times using height.data as the input, generating sample statistics for samples of size 30 each time it’s run. rerun returns a list whose length is the specified number of runs. The third line includes a call the dplyr::bind_rows(). This simply takes the list that rerun returns and collapses the list into a single data frame. df.samples.of.30 is thus a data frame in which each row gives the sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation for a random sample of 30 individuals drawn from our underlying population (height.data). df.samples.of.30 # A tibble: 1,000 x 3 sample.size sample.mean sample.sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 30. 177. 18.0 2 30. 173. 14.6 3 30. 178. 15.1 4 30. 171. 16.9 5 30. 176. 12.7 6 30. 176. 13.5 7 30. 177. 15.2 8 30. 178. 19.3 9 30. 171. 15.5 10 30. 175. 13.0 # ... with 990 more rows 13.4 Simulated sampling distribution of the mean Let’s review what we just did: We generated 1000 samples of size 30 For each of the samples we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the height variable in that sample We combined each of those estimates of the mean and standard deviation into a data frame The 1000 estimates of the mean we generated represents a new distribution – what we will call a sampling distribution of the mean for samples of size 30. Let’s plot this sampling distribution: ggplot(df.samples.of.30, aes(x = sample.mean, y = ..density..)) + geom_histogram(bins=25, fill = &#39;firebrick&#39;, alpha=0.5) + geom_vline(xintercept = true.values$mean.height, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample means&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of mean heights for 1000 samples of size 30&quot;) This particular sampling distribution of the mean is a probability distribution that we can use to estimate the probability that a sample mean falls within a given interval, assuming our sample is a random sample of size 30 drawn from our underlying population. From our visualization, we see that the distribution of sample mean heights is approximately centered around the true mean height. Most of the sample estiamtes of the mean height are within 5 cm of the true population mean height (175.6cm), but a small number of estimates of the sample mean as off by nearly 10cm. Let’s make this more precise by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means (I included the min and max as well). df.samples.of.30 %&gt;% summarize(mean.of.means = mean(sample.mean), sd.of.means = sd(sample.mean), min.of.means = min(sample.mean), max.of.means = max(sample.mean)) # A tibble: 1 x 4 mean.of.means sd.of.means min.of.means max.of.means &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 176. 2.85 167. 185. 13.4.1 Sampling distributions for different sample sizes In the example above we simulated the sampling distribution of the mean for samples of size 30. How would the sampling distribution change if we increased the sample size? In the next code block we generate sampling distributions of the mean (and standard deviation) for samples of size 50, 100, 250, and 500. df.samples.of.50 &lt;- rerun(1000, height.data %&gt;% rsample.stats(50, &quot;height&quot;)) %&gt;% bind_rows() df.samples.of.100 &lt;- rerun(1000, height.data %&gt;% rsample.stats(100, &quot;height&quot;)) %&gt;% bind_rows() df.samples.of.250 &lt;- rerun(1000, height.data %&gt;% rsample.stats(250, &quot;height&quot;)) %&gt;% bind_rows() df.samples.of.500 &lt;- rerun(1000, height.data %&gt;% rsample.stats(500, &quot;height&quot;)) %&gt;% bind_rows() To make plotting and comparison easier we will combine each of the individual data frames, representing the different sampling distributions for samples of a given size, into a single data frame. df.combined &lt;- bind_rows(df.samples.of.30, df.samples.of.50, df.samples.of.100, df.samples.of.250, df.samples.of.500) %&gt;% # create a factor version of sample size to facilitate plotting mutate(sample.sz = as.factor(sample.size)) We then plot each of the individual sampling distributions, faceting on sample size. ggplot(df.combined, aes(x = sample.mean, y = ..density.., fill = sample.sz)) + geom_histogram(bins=25, alpha=0.5) + geom_vline(xintercept = true.values$mean.height, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ sample.sz, nrow = 1) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;) + # change color palette labs(x = &quot;Sample means&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Distribution of mean heights for samples of varying size&quot;) 13.4.2 Discussion of trends for sampling distributions of different sample sizes The key trend we see when comparing the sampling distributions of the mean for samples of different size is that as the sample size gets larger, the spread of the sampling distribution of the mean becomes narrower around the true mean. This means that as sample size increases, the uncertainty associated with our estimates of the mean decreases. Let’s create a table, grouped by sample size, to help quantify this pattern: sampling.distn.mean.table &lt;- df.combined %&gt;% group_by(sample.size) %&gt;% summarize(mean.of.means = mean(sample.mean), sd.of.means = sd(sample.mean), min.of.means = min(sample.mean), max.of.means = max(sample.mean)) sampling.distn.mean.table # A tibble: 5 x 5 sample.size mean.of.means sd.of.means min.of.means max.of.means &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 30. 176. 2.85 167. 185. 2 50. 176. 2.16 169. 182. 3 100. 176. 1.47 171. 180. 4 250. 176. 0.967 173. 179. 5 500. 176. 0.665 174. 178. 13.5 Standard Error of the Mean We see from the graph and table above that our estimates of the mean cluster more tightly about the true mean as our sample size increases. This is obvious when we compare the standard deviation of our mean estimates as a function of sample size. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic of interest is called the Standard Error of that statistic. Here, through simulation, we are approximating the Standard Error of the Mean. When sample sizes are large (&gt;30 observations), one can show mathematically that for normally distributed data the expected Standard Error of the Mean as a function of sample size is approximately: \\[ \\mbox{Standard Error of Mean} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation (i.e. the “true” standard deviation), and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Let’s compare that theoretical expectation to our simulated results: se.mean.theory &lt;- sapply(seq(10,500,10), function(n){ true.values$sd.height/sqrt(n) }) df.se.mean.theory &lt;- data_frame(sample.size = seq(10,500,10), std.error = se.mean.theory) ggplot(sampling.distn.mean.table, aes(x = sample.size, y = sd.of.means)) + # plot standard errors of mean based on our simulations geom_point() + # plot standard errors of the mean based on theory geom_line(aes(x = sample.size, y = std.error), data = df.se.mean.theory, color=&quot;red&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample size&quot;, y = &quot;Std Error of Mean&quot;, title = &quot;A comparison of theoretical (red line) and simulated (points) estimates of\\nthe standard error of the mean for samples of different size&quot;) We see that as sample sizes increase, the standard error of the mean decreases. This means that as our samples get larger, our uncertainty in our sample estimate of the mean (our best guess for the population mean) gets smaller. 13.6 Sampling Distribution of the Standard Deviation Above we explored how the sampling distribution of the mean changes with sample size. We can similarly explore the sampling distribution of any other statistic, such as the standard deviation, or the median, or the the range, etc. Recall that when we drew random samples we calculated the standard deviation of each of those samples in addition to the mean. This means we can immediately visualize the sampling distribution of the standard deviation as shown below: ggplot(df.combined, aes(x = sample.sd, y = ..density.., fill = sample.sz)) + geom_histogram(bins=25, alpha=0.5) + geom_vline(xintercept = true.values$sd.height, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ sample.sz, nrow = 1) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample standard deviations&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Sampling distribution of standard deviation of height for samples of varying size&quot;) The key trend we saw when examining the sampling distribution of the mean is also apparent for standard deviation – bigger samples lead to tighter sampling distributions and hence less uncertainty in the sample estimates of the standard deviation. As before, we summarize key statistics of the sampling distribution in a table: sampling.distn.sd.table &lt;- df.combined %&gt;% group_by(sample.size) %&gt;% summarize(mean.of.sds = mean(sample.sd), sd.of.sds = sd(sample.sd), min.of.sds = min(sample.sd), max.of.sds = max(sample.sd)) sampling.distn.sd.table # A tibble: 5 x 5 sample.size mean.of.sds sd.of.sds min.of.sds max.of.sds &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 30. 15.2 2.02 9.58 21.3 2 50. 15.2 1.56 10.1 20.9 3 100. 15.1 1.11 11.9 18.7 4 250. 15.2 0.690 13.1 17.8 5 500. 15.2 0.465 13.6 17.0 For normally distributed data the expected Standard Error of the Standard Deviation (i.e. the standard deviation of standard deviations!) is approximately: \\[ \\mbox{Standard Error of Standard Deviation} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2(n-1)}} \\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation, and \\(n\\) is the sample size. As before, let’s visually compare the theoretical expectation to our simulated estimates. se.sd.theory &lt;- sapply(seq(10, 500, 10), function(n){ true.values$sd.height/sqrt(2*(n-1))}) df.se.sd.theory &lt;- data_frame(sample.size = seq(10,500,10), std.error = se.sd.theory) ggplot(sampling.distn.sd.table, aes(x = sample.size, y = sd.of.sds)) + # plot standard errors of mean based on our simulations geom_point() + # plot standard errors of the mean based on theory geom_line(aes(x = sample.size, y = std.error), data = df.se.sd.theory, color=&quot;red&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample size&quot;, y = &quot;Std Error of Standard Deviation&quot;, title = &quot;A comparison of theoretical (red line) and simulated (points) estimates of\\nthe standard error of the standard deviation for samples of different size&quot;) 13.7 What happens to the sampling distribution of the mean and standard deviation when our sample size is small? We would hope that, regardless of sample size, the sampling distributions of both the mean and standard deviation should be centered around the true population value, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) respectively. That seemed to be the case for the modest to large sample sizes we’ve looked at so far (30 to 500 observations). Does this also hold for small samples? Let’s use simulation to explore how well this is expectation is met for small samples. As we’ve done before, we simulate the sampling distribution of the mean and standard deviation for samples of varying size (we also calculate some other values which will be useful for our exposition below). # we&#39;ll use the same mean and sd we&#39;ve been using previously mu = mean.ht sigma = sd.ht # list of sample sizes we&#39;ll generate ssizes &lt;- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30) # number of simulations to carry out *for each sample size* nsims &lt;- 2500 df.combined.small &lt;- data_frame(sample.size = double(), sample.mean = double(), sample.sd = double(), estimated.SE = double(), sample.zscore = double()) for (i in ssizes) { # create empty vectors to hold simulation stats (for efficiency) s.means &lt;- rep(NA, nsims) s.sds &lt;- rep(NA, nsims) s.SEs &lt;- rep(NA, nsims) s.zscores &lt;- rep(NA, nsims) for (j in 1:nsims) { s &lt;- rnorm(i, mean = mu, sd = sigma) # draw random sample s.means[j] &lt;- mean(s) # calculate mean of that sample s.sds[j] &lt;- sd(s) # calculate sd of that sample SE &lt;- sd(s)/sqrt(i) # cacluate estimated SE of that sample s.SEs[j] &lt;- SE s.zscores[j] &lt;- (mean(s) - mu)/SE } df &lt;- data.frame(sample.size = i, sample.mean = s.means, sample.sd = s.sds, estimated.SE = s.SEs, sample.zscore = s.zscores) df.combined.small &lt;- bind_rows(df.combined.small, df) } df.combined.small %&lt;&gt;% mutate(sample.sz = as.factor(sample.size)) 13.7.1 For small samples, sample standard deviations systematically underestimate the population standard deviation Let’s examine how the well centered the sampling distributions of the mean and standard deviation are around their true values, as a function of sample size. First a table summarizing this information: by.sample.size &lt;- df.combined.small %&gt;% group_by(sample.size) %&gt;% summarize(mean.of.means = mean(sample.mean), mean.of.sds = mean(sample.sd)) by.sample.size # A tibble: 8 x 3 sample.size mean.of.means mean.of.sds &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 2. 175. 12.2 2 3. 175. 13.5 3 4. 176. 13.8 4 5. 176. 14.2 5 7. 176. 14.7 6 10. 176. 14.8 7 20. 176. 15.0 8 30. 176. 15.1 We see that the sampling distributions of means are well centered around the true mean, and there is no systematic bias one way or the other. By contrast the sampling distribution of standard deviations tends to underestimate the true standard deviation when the samples are small (less than 30 observations). We can visualize this bias as shown here: ggplot(by.sample.size, aes(x = sample.size, y = mean.of.sds)) + geom_point(color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_line(color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_hline(yintercept = sigma, color = &#39;black&#39;, linetype=&#39;dashed&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample Size&quot;, y = &quot;Mean of Sampling Distn of Std Dev&quot;) The source of this bias is clear if we look at the sampling distribution of the standard deviation for samples of size 3, 5, and 30. filtered.df &lt;- df.combined.small %&gt;% filter(sample.size %in% c(3, 5, 30)) ggplot(filtered.df, aes(x = sample.sd, y = ..density.., fill = sample.sz)) + geom_histogram(bins=50, alpha=0.65) + facet_wrap(~sample.size, nrow = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = sigma, linetype = &#39;dashed&#39;) + labs(x = &quot;Std Deviations&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;, title = &quot;Sampling distributions of the standard deviation\\nAs a function of sample size&quot;) There’s very clear indication that the the sampling distribution of standard deviations is not centered around the true value for \\(n=3\\) and for \\(n=5\\), however with samples of size 30 the sampling distribution of the standard deviation appears fairly well centered around the true value of the underlying population. 13.7.2 Underestimates of the standard deviation given small \\(n\\) lead to understimates of the SE of the mean When sample sizes are small, sample estimates of the standard deviation, \\(s_x\\), tend to underestimate the true standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), then it follows that sample estimates of the standard error of the mean, \\(SE_\\overline{x} = \\frac{s_x}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), must tend to understimate the true standard error of the mean, \\(SE_\\mu = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). 13.8 The t-distribution is the appropriate distribution for describing the sampling distribution of the mean when \\(n\\) is small The problem associated with estimating the standard error of the mean for small sample sizes was recognized in the early 20th century by William Gosset, an employee at the Guinness Brewing Company. He published a paper, under the pseudonym “Student”, giving the appropriate distribution for describing the standard error of the mean as a function of the sample size \\(n\\). Gosset’s distribution is known as the “t-distribution” or “Student’s t-distribution”. The t-distribution is specified by a single parameter, called degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)) where \\({df} = n - 1\\). As \\(df\\) increases, the t-distribution becomes more and more like the normal such that when \\(n \\geq 30\\) it’s nearly indistinguishable from the standard normal distribution. In the figures below we compare the t-distribution and the standard normal distribution for sample sizes \\(n = {4, 8, 32}\\). x &lt;- seq(-6, 6, length.out = 200) n &lt;- c(5, 10, 30) # sample sizes distns.df &lt;- data_frame(sample.size = double(), z.or.t = double(), norm.density = double(), t.density = double()) for (i in n) { norm.density &lt;- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1) t.density &lt;- dt(x, df = i - 1) df.temp &lt;- data_frame(sample.size = i, z.or.t = x, norm.density = norm.density, t.density = t.density) distns.df &lt;- bind_rows(distns.df, df.temp) } distns.df %&lt;&gt;% mutate(df = as.factor(sample.size - 1)) ggplot(distns.df, aes(x = z.or.t, y = t.density, color = df)) + geom_line() + geom_line(aes(y = norm.density), color=&#39;black&#39;, linetype=&quot;dotted&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;z or t value&quot;, y = &quot;Probablity density&quot;, title = &quot;Standard normal distribution (black dotted line)\\nversus t-distributions for different degrees of freedom&quot;) US Dept. of Health and Human Services; et al.
