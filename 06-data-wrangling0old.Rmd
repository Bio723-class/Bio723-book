# Data wrangling

In the real world you'll often create a data set (or be given one) in a format that is less than ideal for analysis.  This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, the data may have been recorded in a manner convenient for collection and visual inspection, but which does not work well for analysis and plotting.  Or the data may be an amalgamation of multiple experiments, in which each of the experimenters used slightly different naming conventions. Or the data may have been produced by an instrument that produces output with a fixed format.  Sometimes important experimental information is included in the column headers of a spreadsheet.

Whatever the case, we often find ourselves in the situation where we need to "wrangle" our data into a "tidy" format before we can proceed with visualization and analysis. The "R for Data Science" text discusses some desirable rules for "tidy" data in order to facilitate downstream analyses. These are:

  1. Each variable must have its own column.
  1. Each observation must have its own row.
  1. Each value must have its own cell.

In this chapter we're going to walk through an extended example of wrangling some data into a "tidy" format.

## Libraries


```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(readr)
```


## Data

To illustrate a standard data wrangling pipeline, we're going to use a gene expression microarray data set, based on the following paper:

* Spellman PT, et al. 1998. Comprehensive identification of cell cycle-regulated genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by microarray hybridization. Mol Biol Cell 9(12): 3273-97.

In this paper, Spellman and colleagues tried to identify all the genes in the yeast genome (>6000 genes) that exhibited oscillatory behaviors suggestive of cell cycle regulation.  To do so, they combined gene expression measurements from six different types of cell cycle synchronization experiments.


*Download the Spellman data to your filesystem* from [this link](https://github.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/blob/master/spellman-combined.txt) (right-click the "Download" button and save to your Downloads folder or similar).  

I suggest that once you download the data, you open it in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) or use the RStudio Data Viewer to get a sense of what the data looks like.

Let's load it into R, using the `read_tsv()` function, using the appropriate file path. 

```{r}
# the filepath may differ on your computer
spellman <- read_tsv("~/Downloads/spellman-combined.txt")
```

The initial dimenions of the data frame are:

```{r}
dim(spellman)
```


The six types of cell cycle synchronization experiments are:

1. synchronization by alpha-factor = "alpha"
2. synchronization by cdc15 temperature sensitive mutants = "cdc15"
3. synchronization by cdc28 temperature sensitive mutants = "cdc28"
4. synchronization by elutration = "elu"
5. synchronization by cln3 mutatant strains = "cln3"
6. synchronization by clb2 mutant strains = "clb2"


## Renaming data frame columms 

Notice that when we imported the data we got a warning message: `Missing column names filled in: 'X1' [1]`.  In a data frame, every column must have a name. The first column of our data set did not have a name in the header, so `read_tsv` automatically gave it the name `X1`.  

Our first task is to give the first column a more meaningful name.  This column gives "systematic gene names" -- a standardized naming scheme for genes in the yeast genome.  We'll use `dplyr::rename` to do rename `X1` to `gene`.  Note that `rename` can take multiple arguments if you need to rename multiple columns simultaneously.

```{r}
spellman.clean <- 
  spellman %>%
  rename(gene = X1)
```


## Dropping unneeded columns

Take a look at the Spellman data again in your spreadsheet program (or the R Studio data viewer).  You'll notice there are some blank columns.  These are simply visual organizing elements that the creator of the spreadsheet added to separate the different experiments that are included in the data set. 

We can use `dplyr::select` to drop columns by prependingcolumn names with the negative sign:

```{r}
# drop the alpha column keeping all others
spellman.clean %<>% 
  select(-alpha)  
```

Note that usually `select()`  keeps only the variables you specify.  However if the first expression is negative, `select` will instead automatically keep all variables, dropping only those you specify. 

### Finding all empty columns

In the example above, we looked at the data and saw that the "alpha" column was empty, and thus dropped it.  This worked  because there are only a modest number of columns in the data frame in it's initial form.  However, if our data frame contained thousands of columns, this "look and see" procedure would not be efficient.  Can we come up with a general solution for removing empty columns from a data frame?

When you load a data frame from a spreadsheet, empty cells are given the value `NA`.  In previous class sessions we were introduced to the function `is.na()` which tests each value in a vector or data frame for whether it's NA or not.  We can count NA values in a vector by summing the output of `is.na()`. Conversely we can count the number of "not NA" items by using the negation operator (`!`):

```{r}
# count number of NA values in the alpha0 column
sum(is.na(spellman$alpha0))

# count number of values that are NOT NA in alpha0
sum(!is.na(spellman$alpha0))
```

This seems like it should get us close to a solution but `sum(is.na(..))` when applied to a data frame counts NAs across the entire data frame, not column-by-column.

```{r}
# doesn't do what we hoped!
sum(is.na(spellman))
```

If we want sums of NAs by column, we instead use the `colSums()` function:

```{r}
# get number of NAs by column
colSums(is.na(spellman))
```

Columns with *all* missing values can be more conveniently found by asking for those columns where the number of "not missing" values is zero:

```{r}
# get names of all columns for which all rows are NA
# useing standard indexing
names(spellman)[colSums(!is.na(spellman)) == 0]
```

We can combine the `colSums(!is.na())` idiom with the `dplyr::select_if` function to quickly remove all empty columns as so:

```{r}
spellman.clean %<>%
  # keep ONLY the non-empty columns
  select_if(colSums(!is.na(.)) > 0)
```




### Dropping columns by matching names

Only two time points from the cln3 and clb2 experiments were reported in the original publication. Since complete time series are unavailable for these two experimental conditions we will drop them from further consideration.  

`select()` can be called be called with a number of "helper function" (`?select_helpers`). Here we'll illustrate the `matches()` helper function which matches column names to a "regular expression".  Regular expressions (also referred to as "regex" or "regexp") are a way of specifying patterns in string. For the purposes of this document we'll illustrate  regexs by example; for a more detailed explanation of regular expressions see the the regex help(`?regex`) and the [Chapter on Strings in "R for Data Analysis"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html): 

Let's see how to drop all the "cln3" and "clb2" columns from the data frame using `matches()`:

```{r}
spellman.clean %<>% 
  select(-matches("cln3")) %>%
  select(-matches("clb2"))
```

If we wanted we could have collapsed our two match statements into one as follows:

```{r}
spellman.clean %<>% 
  select(-matches("cln3|clb2"))
```

In this second example, the character "|" is specifing an OR match within the regular expression, so this regular expression matches column names that contain "cln3" OR "clb2".




## Reshaping data with tidyr

The `tidyr` package provides functions for reshaping or tidying data frames.  `tidyr` is yet another component of the tidyverse, and thus was loaded by the `library(tidyverse)`. 

Today we're going to look at two functions `tidyr::gather()` and `tidyr::extract()`, and how they can be combined with now familiar `dplyr` functions we've seen previously.  The reading assignment for today's class session covers a variety of other functions defined in `tidyr`.
 
The Spellman data, as I provided it to you, is in what we would call "wide" format.  Each column (besides the `gene` column) corresponds to an experimental condition *and* time point.  For example, "alpha0" is the alpha-factor experiment at time point 0 mins; "alpha7" is the alpha-factor experiment at time point 7 mins, etc.  The cells within each column correspond to the expression of a corresponding gene (given by the first column which we renamed `gene`) in that particular experiment at that particular time point.

In every column (except "gene"), the cellsrepresents the same abstract property of interest -- the expression of a gene of interest in a particular experiment/time point.  Our first task will be to rearrange our "wide" data frame that consists of many different columns representing gene expression into a "long" data frame with just a single column representing expression.  We'll also create a new column to keep track of the which experiment and time point the measurement came from.

### Wide to long conversions using `tidyr::gather`

`tidyr::gather()` takes multiple columns, and collapses them together into a smaller number of new columns.  When using `gather()` you give the names of the *new *columns to create, as well as the names of any existing columns `gather` should *not* collect together.

Here we want to collapse all 73 or the expression columns -- "alpha0" to "elu390" -- into two columns: 1) a column to represent the expt/time point of the measurement, and 2) a column to represent the corresponding expression value.  The only column we don't want to touch is the `gene` column with our gene names.

```{r}
# convert "wide" data to "long"
spellman.long <-
  spellman.clean %>%
  gather(expt.and.time, expression, -gene)
```

Take a moment to look at the data in the "long format":

```{r}
head(spellman.long)
```

And compare the dimensions of the wide data to the new data:

```{r}
dim(spellman.clean)  # for comparison
dim(spellman.long)
```

As you see, we've gone from a data frame with `r nrow(spellman.clean)` rows and `r ncol(spellman.clean)` columns (wide format), to a new data frame with `r nrow(spellman.long)` rows and `r ncol(spellman.long)` columns (long format). 

### Extracting information from combined variables using `tidyr::extract`

The column `expt.and.time` violates one of our principles of tidy data: "Each variable must have its own column.".  This column conflates two different types of information -- the experiment type and the time point of the measurement.  Our next task is to split this information up into two new variables, which will help to facilitate downstream plotting and analysis.

One complicating factor is that the different experiments/time combinations have different naming conventions:

  * The "alpha" and "elu" experiments are of the form "alpha0", "alpha7", "elu0", "elu30", etc.  In this case, the first part of the string gives the experiment type (either alpha or elu) and the following digits give the time point. 

  * In the "cdc15" and "cdc28" experiments the convention is slightly different; they are of the form "cdc15_0", "cdc15_10", "cdc28_0", "cdc28_10", etc.  Here the part of the string before the underscore gives the experiment type, and the digits after the underscore give the time point.
  
Because of the differences in naming conventions, we will find it easiest to break up `spellman.long` into a series of sub-data sets corresponding to each experiment type in order to extract out the experiment and time information.  After processing each data subset separately, we will join the modified sub-data frames back together.

###  Subsetting rows 

Let's start by getting just the rows corresponding to the "alpha" experiment/times. Here we use `dplyr::filter` in combination with `stringr::str_detect` to get all those rows in which the `expt.and.time` variable contains the string "alpha".

```{r}
alpha.long <- 
  spellman.long %>%
  filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, "alpha"))

# look at the new data frame
dim(alpha.long)
head(alpha.long, n = 10)
```

### Splitting columns

Having subsetted the data, we can now split `expt.and.time` into two new variables -- `expt` and `time`.  To do this we use `tidyr::extract`.


```{r}
alpha.long %<>% 
  tidyr::extract(expt.and.time,     # column we're extracting from
                 c("expt", "time"), # new columns we're creating
                 regex="(alpha)([[:digit:]]+)",  # regexp (see below)
                 convert=TRUE)      # automatically convert column types

# NOTE: I'm being explict about saying tidyr::extract because the
# magrittr package defines a different extract function
```


Let's take a moment to look at the `regex` argument to `extract` --  `regex="(alpha)([[:digit:]]+)"`.  The regex is specified as a character string.  Each part we want to match *and* extract is surround by parentheses.  In this case we have two sets of parentheses corresponding to the two matches we want to make.  The first part of the regex is `(alpha)`; here we're looking to make an exact match to the string "alpha".  The second part of the regex reads `([[:digit:]]+)`. `[[:digit:]]` indicates we're looking for a numeric digit.  The `+` after `[[:digit:]]` indicates that we want to match  *one or more* digits (i.e. to get a match we need to find at least one digit, but more than one digit should also be a match).


Let's take a look at the new version of `alpha.long` following application of `extract`:

```{r}
head(alpha.long, n = 10)
```

Notice our two new variables, both of which have appropriate types!

A data frame for the elutriation data can be created similarly:

```{r}
elu.long <-
  spellman.long %>%
  filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, "elu")) %>%
  tidyr::extract(expt.and.time,     # column we're extracting from
                 c("expt", "time"), # new columns we're creating
                 regex="(elu)([[:digit:]]+)",  # regexp (see below)
                 convert=TRUE)      # automatically convert column types
```


#### A fancier regex for the cdc experiments

Now let's process the cdc experiments (cdc15 and cdc28).  As before we extract the corresponding rows of the data frame using `filter` and `str_detect`.  We then split `expt.and.time` using `tidyr::extract`.  In this case we carry out the two steps in a single code block using pipes:

```{r}
cdc.long <- 
  spellman.long %>%
  # both cdc15 and cdc28 contain "cdc" as a sub-string
  filter(str_detect(expt.and.time, "cdc")) %>%
  tidyr::extract(expt.and.time, 
                 c("expt", "time"), 
                 regex="(cdc15|cdc28)_([[:digit:]]+)", # note the fancier regex
                 convert=TRUE)
```

The regex -- `"(cdc15|cdc28)_([[:digit:]]+)"` -- is slightly fancier in this example. As before there are two parts we're extracting: `(cdc15|cdc28)` and `([[:digit:]]+)`.  The first parenthesized regexp is an "OR" -- i.e. match "cdc15" *or* "cdc28".  The second parenthesized regexp is the same as we saw previously.  Separating the two parenthesized regexps is an underscore (`_`).  The underscore isn't parenthesized because we only want to use it to make a match *not* to extract the corresponding match.




### Combining data frame rows

If you have two or more data frames with identical columns, the rows of the data frame can be combined using `rbind` (defined in the `base` package).  For example, to reassemble the `alpha.long`, `elu.long`, and `cdc.long` data frames into a single data frame we do:

```{r}
spellman.final <- rbind(alpha.long, elu.long, cdc.long)

# check the dimensions of the new data frame
dim(spellman.final)
```

### Sorting data frame rows

Currently the `spellman.final` data frame is sorted by time point and experiment.  

```{r}
head(spellman.final, n = 10)
```

It might be useful instead to sort by gene and experiment.  To do this we can use `dplyr::arrange`:

```{r}
spellman.final %<>%
  arrange(gene, expt)

# look again at the rearranged data
head(spellman.final, n = 10)
```


### Collapsing columns using `tidyr::unite` 

`unite` combines the data from multiple columns into one, separating the column data with a consistent separator character (the underscore character "_" by default).  For example, if we wanted to combined the experiment and time columns again (recall that we previously separated with with `extract`) we could do:

```{r}
spellman.recombined <-
  spellman.final %>%
  unite(expt.and.time, expt, time)  # give new column name first
                                    # then give columns to combine

dim(spellman.recombined)
head(spellman.recombined, n = 10)
```

### Splitting columns using `tidyr::separate`

`separate` splits a column into multiple columns.  It's very much like `extract` except that it only takes a single regex for the separator, which by default is any non-alphabetic or non-numeric character. For example, to re-split `expt.and.time` in `spellman.recombined` we could do:

```{r}
spellman.respread <- 
  spellman.recombined %>%
  separate(expt.and.time, c("expt", "time"), convert = TRUE)

dim(spellman.respread)
head(spellman.respread,n= 10)
```

Faced with the task of splitting columns, try `tidyr::separate` first and only consider `tidyr::extract` if you need to defines more sophisticated rules for splitting.

### Long-to-wide conversion using `tidyr::spread`

`tidyr::spread` is the inverse of `tidyr::gather`.  `gather()` took multiple columns and collapsed them together into a smaller number of new columns.  The `tidyr` documentation calls this "collapsing into key-value pairs".  By contrast, `spread()` creates new columns by spreading "key-value pairs" (a column representing the "keys" and a column reprsenting the "values") into multiple columns.  

Here let's use spread to use the gene names (the "key") and expression measures (the "values") to create a new data frame where the genes are the primary variables (columns) of the data. 

```{r}
spellman.gene.focused <-
  spellman.final %>%
  spread(gene, expression)

dim(spellman.gene.focused)
```


Both "long" and "wide" tidy versions of the same data are useful, depending on the specific analyses and/or visualiztions you want to accomplish. We'll look at applications of both in the sections that follow.


## Using your tidy data

Whew -- that was a fair amount of work to tidy our data!  But having done so we can now carry out a wide variety of very powerful analyses.  

### Visualizing gene expression time series

Let's start by walking through a series of visualizations of gene expression time series.  Each plot will show the expression of one or more genes, at different time points, in one or more experimental conditions. Our initial visualizations exploit the "long" versions of the tidy data.

First a single gene in a single experimental condition:

```{r}
spellman.final %>%
  filter(expt == "alpha", gene == "YAL022C") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    labs(x = "Time (mins)", y = "Expression of YAL022C")
```

We can easily modify the above code block to visualize the expression of multiple genes of interest:

```{r}
genes.of.interest <- c("YAL022C", "YAR018C", "YGR188C")

spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest, expt == "alpha") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) +
    geom_line() + 
    labs(x = "Time (mins)", y = "Normalized expression",
         title = "Expression of multiple genes\nfollowing synchronization by alpha factor")
```
By employing `facet_wrap()` we can visualize the relationship between this set of genes in each of the experiment types:

```{r}
spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) +
    geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap(~ expt) +
    labs(x = "Time (mins)", y = "Normalized expression",
         title = "Expression of Multiple Genes\nAcross experiments") 
```

The different experimental treatments were carried out for varying lengths of time due to the differences in their physiological effects. Plotting them all on the same time scale can obscure that patterns of oscillation we might be interested in, so let's modify our code block so that plots that share the same y-axis, but have differently scaled x-axes.

```{r}
spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% genes.of.interest) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = gene)) +
    geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = "free_x") +
    labs(x = "Time (mins)", y = "Normalized expression",
         title = "Expression of Multiple Genes\nAcross experiments") 
```


### Finding the most variable genes

When dealing with vary large data sets, one ad hoc filtering criteria that is often employed is to focus on those variables that exhibit that greatest variation.  To do this, we first need to order our variables (genes) by their variation.  Let's see how we can accomplish this using our long data frame:

```{r}
by.variance <-
  spellman.final %>%
  group_by(gene) %>% 
  summarize(expression.var = var(expression, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(expression.var))

head(by.variance)
```

The code above calculates variance but ignores the fact that we have different experimental conditions.  To take into account the experimental design of the data at hand, let's calculate the average variance across the experimental conditions:

```{r}
by.avg.variance <-
  spellman.final %>%
  group_by(gene, expt) %>% 
  summarize(expression.var = var(expression, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(gene) %>%
  summarize(avg.expression.var = mean(expression.var)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg.expression.var))

head(by.avg.variance)
```

Based on the average experession variance across experimental conditions, let's get the names of the 1000 most variable genes:

```{r}
top.genes.1k <- by.avg.variance[1:1000,]$gene

head(top.genes.1k)
```

### Exploring bivariate relationships using "wide" data

The "long" version of our data frame proved useful for exploring how gene expression changed over time.  By contrast, our "wide" data frame is more convient for exploring how pairs of genes covary together.  For example, we can generate bivariate scatter plots depicting the relationship between two genes in the four different experimental conditions:

```{r}
spellman.gene.focused %>%
  filter(!is.na(YAL022C) & !is.na(YAR018C)) %>%  # filter any missing values
  ggplot(aes(x = YAL022C, y = YAR018C)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1) + 
    facet_wrap(~expt, nrow = 2, ncol = 2) 
```

### Calculating correlations between genes


Let's explore more global bivariate relationships by calculating all the pairwise correlations between genes, focusing our attention on only the top 1000 most variable genes (as calculated previously).

Correlation is a measure of linear association between a pair of variables, and ranges from -1 to 1. A value near zero indicates the variables are uncorrelated (no linear association), while values approaching +1 indicate a strong positive association (the variables tend to get bigger or smaller together) while values near -1 indicate strong negative association (when one variable is larger, the other tends to be small).  

First, let's reduce our "wide" data frame to including only the top 1000 genes:

```{r}
top.1k.wide <-
  spellman.gene.focused %>%
  # get expt and time column plus top 1000 genes
  select(expt, time, top.genes.1k) 

dim(top.1k.wide)
```
Now, we calculate the correlations between all those genes. We need to drop two columns from the data frame, corresponding to "expt" and "time", and we then use the `cor` function to calculate the pairwise correlations. Since there is missing data (indicated with NAs) we also need to tell the `cor` function to only use pairwise complete observations when calculating correlations.

```{r}
spellman.cor <- 
  top.1k.wide %>%
  select(-expt, -time)  %>% # drop expt and time
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

The correlation matrix is a square matrix with the number of rows and columns equal to the number of variables: 

```{r}
dim(spellman.cor)
```

To get the correlations with a gene of interest, we can index with the gene name on the rows of the correlation matrix. For example, to get all the correlations between the gene YAL022C and the other genes in the top 1000 set:

```{r}
head(spellman.cor["YAL022C",])  
```


In the next statement we extract the names of the genes that have correlations with YAL022C greater than 0.6.   First we test genes to see if they have a correlation with YAL022C greater than 0.6, which returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE values.  This vector of Boolean values is than used to index into the rownames of the correlation matrix, pulling out the gene names where the statement was true.

```{r}
pos.corr.YAL022C <- rownames(spellman.cor)[spellman.cor["YAL022C",] > 0.6]
length(pos.corr.YAL022C)
```
We then return to our wide data to show this set of genes that are strongly positively correlated with YAL022C, using faceted line graphs:

```{r}
spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% pos.corr.YAL022C) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = expt, group = gene)) + 
    geom_line(alpha = 0.33) +
    facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = "free_x", nrow = 2, ncol = 2) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```


We can similarly filter for genes that have negative correlations with YAL022C. 

```{r}
neg.corr.YAL022C <- colnames(spellman.cor)[spellman.cor["YAL022C",] <= -0.4]
```

As before we generate a faceted line plot showing these genes by experiment:

```{r}
spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% neg.corr.YAL022C) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = expression, color = expt, group = gene)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.33) +
    facet_wrap(~ expt, scales = "free_x", nrow = 2, ncol = 2) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")  
```



### Adding new columns and combining filtered data frames

Now let's create a new data frame by: 1) filtering on our list of genes that have strong positive and negative correlations with YAL022C; and 2) creating a new variable, "corr.with.YAL022C", which indicates the sign of the correlation.  We'll use this new variable to group genes when we create the plot.

```{r}
pos.corr.df <- spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% pos.corr.YAL022C) %>%
  mutate(corr.with.YAL022C = "positive")

neg.corr.df <- spellman.final %>%
  filter(gene %in% neg.corr.YAL022C) %>%
  mutate(corr.with.YAL022C = "negative")

combined.pos.neg <- rbind(pos.corr.df, neg.corr.df)
```

Finally, we plot the data, colored according to the correlation with YAL022C. 

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height=6}
ggplot(combined.pos.neg, 
       aes(x = time, y = expression,  group = gene,
           color = corr.with.YAL022C)) + 
  geom_line(alpha=0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~ expt, nrow =2, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x") +
  # changes legend title for discrete color legends
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Correlation with YAL022C") 
```
